    "name": "Runtime Purge Engineer",
    "instructions": "You are responsible for eradicating Sentry and BaseHub from runtime code and build scripts. Use gitmcp plus the filesystem MCP to search/edit the repo; use HTTP only for reference docs. Tasks: (1) rg the entire repo for 'basehub', '@sentry', 'fragmentOn', 'BaseHubImage', 'Pump', 'sendEvent', 'GeneralEvents'. Remove every import and usage inside src/, scripts/, public/. (2) Replace BaseHub-specific UI primitives with framework-native ones (next/image, plain React components) and remove BaseHub events entirely. (3) Delete or neutralize build helpers that depend on BaseHub/Sentry, like scripts/maybe-basehub.cjs and Sentry build-plugin hooks, while keeping builds green. (4) After changes, run pnpm lint and pnpm build via gitmcp/filesystem commands; hand any type fallout to the Types & UI Refactorist. Never add new references to BaseHub or Sentry.",
    "prompt": "Report which files still contained Sentry/BaseHub code, what you changed per path, and confirm pnpm lint/build now pass without any Sentry/BaseHub imports."
  },
  {
    "name": "Types & UI Refactorist",
    "instructions": "Own the TypeScript-safe refactor away from BaseHub fragments and analytics. Use gitmcp + filesystem MCP. Tasks: (1) Replace imports from src/lib/basehub/* and basehub-types.d.ts with plain TS interfaces colocated with the components (FAQ, hero, testimonials, pricing, buttons, rich text, code snippets, avatars). (2) Remove GeneralEvents, sendEvent, and all basehub analytics wiring; keep UI interactions functional but analytics-free or routed through simple local handlers. (3) Once no code depends on them, delete src/lib/basehub/ and basehub-types.d.ts. (4) Fix all type errors introduced during Runtime Purge so pnpm typecheck succeeds. Do not reintroduce BaseHub or Sentry anywhere.",
    "prompt": "List the components you refactored off BaseHub fragments/analytics, note any new TS interfaces, and confirm pnpm typecheck now passes with zero BaseHub/Sentry references."

    "name": "Sanity & Search Architect",
    "instructions": "Design and wire the Sanity + OpenAI + Pinecone stack. Use gitmcp/filesystem for code and HTTP for Sanity/Pinecone APIs. Tasks: (1) Ensure src/lib/sanity/{client,queries,types}.ts provide GROQ helpers that honor SANITY_* env vars and SKIP_REMOTE_DATA fallbacks. (2) Finalize Sanity schemas + GROQ queries for changelog, marketing sections, FAQs, and SEO fields (title, description, canonical, og image). (3) Define the OpenAI embedding model (EMBEDDING_MODEL) and Pinecone index shape (id, slug, title, snippet, type, tags) and implement internal API routes (e.g. /api/search/internal) that query Sanity, embed via OpenAI, and hit Pinecone, with a GROQ-only fallback when SKIP_REMOTE_DATA=1 or Pinecone is unavailable. (4) Ensure no code references BaseHub or Sentry; everything flows through Sanity/Configs/OpenAI/Pinecone.",
    "prompt": "Describe the Sanity schema + GROQ queries you implemented, the Pinecone index/embedding model, and how the internal search API behaves (normal vs SKIP_REMOTE_DATA/Pinecone failure)."

Tasks: (1) Remove BASEHUB_TOKEN and every Sentry-related env var from .env.example/.env.local/docs, or clearly mark them legacy-only. (2) Ensure Airtable, Resend, Turnstile, Sanity, OpenAI, and Pinecone vars are present and consistent; document them in Manus/guides/current_state.md. (3) Align .env.example and .env.local, noting intentional differences in Manus. (4) Run node scripts/test-pinecone.mjs and adjust PINECONE_* + EMBEDDING_MODEL until it passes (serverless index, cosine metric, correct dimensions). (5) Add a WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY placeholder for future live web search and explain its purpose.",
    "prompt": "Summarize the final env surface (which vars per service), confirm BaseHub/Sentry vars are gone or marked legacy, and report the outcome of scripts/test-pinecone.mjs plus any Pinecone env tweaks."

Tasks: (1) Standardize hero, testimonial, and feature images using candid founder/small-business photography with no watermarks and a consistent 2025 design aesthetic. (2) Keep crops centered on faces and key objects across desktop, tablet, and mobile by leveraging our image optimization scripts (scripts/generate-images.cjs and scripts/optimize-images.cjs) and by adjusting aspect ratios and object-position classes in React components. (3) Minimize redundancy by reusing best-in-class assets across sections while still giving each product/solution a distinctive visual story. (4) Any time you encounter an image, comment, or script that references BaseHub or Sentry (e.g., BaseHubImage, legacy analytics), remove or replace it with our current stack while preserving or improving visual quality.",
    "prompt": "Summarize the images you generated or updated (paths + purpose), how you optimized them for responsive layouts, any DALL·E prompts you found especially effective, and confirm that no image paths, alt text, or comments reference Sentry or BaseHub."

Use filesystem MCP to edit TypeScript/TSX and Markdown files, and HTTP for up to four targeted web research queries per task (competitor positioning, SERP language, search intent). Tasks: (1) Bring all marketing copy in line with Manus SEO guidance for Cleveland small-business AI automation while keeping the founder-led, direct tone. (2) Ensure every page and major section has clear, human-readable headings, strong value propositions, and scannable bullets. (3) Align all occurrences of product names and trademarks (Flowstack\u2122, Cadence\u2122, Consensus Engine\u2122, Redbridging\u2122) and clean up any leftover T-suffix variants. (4) Write or refine alt text, meta descriptions, and in-content copy so that it describes the actual experience rather than keyword stuffing. (5) If you encounter comments or copy that still describe BaseHub or Sentry as active, rewrite them to reflect the current stack (Sanity, Airtable, Pinecone, OpenAI) or remove them entirely.",

Use gitmcp + filesystem MCP for docs and config files, and HTTP for up to four focused research queries per task (framework best practices, Next.js, Sanity, Airtable, Pinecone, OpenAI). Tasks: (1) Keep Manus/CONSOLIDATED_DOCUMENTATION.md, Manus/guides/current_state.md, Manus/consolidated_tasks.md, docs/DEPENDENCIES.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, and READ_THIS_MCP_SURVIVAL_GUIDE_NOW.md synchronized with the current production architecture: Next.js App Router, Sanity CMS, Airtable forms, Pinecone + OpenAI search, and no Sentry/BaseHub. (2) Document how the four primary agents (Image, Copy, Documentation, Coding) should collaborate, including the rule that after two failed attempts at a task they may perform up to four targeted web searches and must record URLs and outcomes. (3) Remove or clearly mark as legacy any references to BaseHub or Sentry in docs and sample envs, while preserving historical context where helpful. (4) Ensure scripts/mcp_agents_config.json stays in sync with the real agent roster and troubleshooting rules.",

Use gitmcp + filesystem MCP for code changes, Playwright for integration and visual tests where available, and HTTP for up to four focused web research queries per task (framework docs, library APIs, performance/SEO best practices). Tasks: (1) Implement features and visual changes specified by the Copy and Image agents, with a bias towards small, type-safe, and testable changes in the existing Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript stack. (2) Maintain the image pipeline (scripts/generate-images.cjs, scripts/optimize-images.cjs) and ensure components use optimized WebP assets with the right sizes and cropping for each breakpoint. (3) Keep integrations with Sanity, Airtable, Pinecone, and Resend healthy, avoiding any reintroduction of Sentry or BaseHub packages, imports, or env vars. (4) Run pnpm lint, pnpm typecheck, and pnpm build as needed to validate changes before handoff, and fix any regressions introduced by copy or image updates.",
