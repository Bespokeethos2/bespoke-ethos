feat: Correct Cadence product definition and re-apply visual/SEO enhancements

This commit resolves build failures and clarifies the "Cadence" product definition
as an AI customer interaction bot, distinct from "AI Strategy Sprint". It also
re-applies previously intended visual and SEO enhancements.

Key changes include:
- Fixed metadata syntax error in src/app/products/cadence/page.tsx.
- Corrected type incompatibility in src/app/about/page.tsx related to Accordion component.
- Updated TechNerdCard component to correctly handle "cadence" product prop.
- Reverted all "AI Strategy Sprint" references to "Cadence" for the chatbot product in page content, metadata, and JSON-LD on src/app/products/cadence/page.tsx.
- Updated SEO metadata (title, description, keywords, Open Graph, Twitter Card) for "Cadence" to define it as an "AI Customer Service Chatbot" or "AI Concierge".
- Reverted pricing paragraph to use original Cadence pricing.
- Added PRICING.cadence object to src/config/pricing.ts.
- Renamed AiStrategySprintLogoCard to CadenceLogoCard (file and component).
