docs: Clarify Cadence product and service definitions in launch_consultation guide

This commit updates the `launch_consultation.md` guide to clearly define "Cadence"
as an AI Customer Service Chatbot/AI Concierge and corrects the service renaming
section to align with its true intent. This prevents future confusion regarding
product definitions and SEO strategy.
