feat: Refine tactile aesthetic and update Frontier Models list

This commit refines the "Authentic/Tactile" aesthetic on the Cadence page by
simplifying background treatments, adjusting noise opacity, and enhancing
borders and shadows for various tactile components (hero card, generic cards,
details cards, image cards, and custom list bullets). This aims to address
previous feedback regarding the visual appearance and achieve a more subtle
and consistent look.

Additionally, the "Frontier Models" list on the Cadence page has been updated
to reflect the latest advanced AI models (Gemini 3, GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet).
