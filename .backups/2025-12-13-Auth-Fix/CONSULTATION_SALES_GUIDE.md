## 🎯 Pre-Call Preparation

### Research Checklist (15-30 min before call)

- [ ] Industry news/trends relevant to them
- [ ] Current tech stack (if visible)
- [ ] Previous interactions (emails, forms)

### Your "Why" Reminder

Before every call, read this:

> "I am not selling. I am diagnosing. I am a Tool & Die technician who builds solutions to tight tolerances. I've trained the AI models they're paying to use. I've lived their overwhelm as a small business owner. I get it."

### Technical Setup

- [ ] Quiet environment
- [ ] Camera on (builds trust)
- [ ] Notes ready (not on-screen typing)
- [ ] BespokeEthos website open (for screen share)
- [ ] Pricing page bookmarked

## 🔓 Opening Strong (First 5 Minutes)

### The PPO Framework

**P**urpose → **P**lan → **O**utcome

**Script:**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for jumping on this call. Before we dive in, let me give you a quick roadmap:
>
> **Purpose:** I want to understand your business and see if there's a fit for how I can help.
>
> **Plan:** I'll ask you some questions about what's going on in your business, share a bit about what I do, and then we'll figure out if it makes sense to work together.
>
> **Outcome:** By the end of this call, you'll either walk away with some free insights you can use immediately, or we'll have a clear next step.
>
> Does that work for you?"

### Establish Human Connection

- Comment on something specific from their LinkedIn/website
- Acknowledge their time is valuable
- Be genuinely curious, not salesy

---

## 🔍 Discovery Deep-Dive (15-20 Minutes)

### The "Pain Excavation" Questions

**Start Broad:**
1. "What made you book this call today?"
2. "Tell me about your business and what you're working on."

**Go Deeper (The Gold):**
3. "What's the biggest bottleneck in your operation right now?"
4. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing, what would it be?"
5. "How much time are you personally spending on [that bottleneck] per week?"
6. "What has that cost you in terms of missed opportunities?"

**Future State:**
7. "If we solved that, what does success look like 6 months from now?"
8. "What would getting that time back mean for you personally?"

**Decision Process:**
9. "If we found a solution that made sense, what would your timeline be?"
10. "Who else would need to be involved in making a decision?"

### Active Listening Signals

- "That's really helpful, tell me more about that."
- "I hear you saying [X], is that right?"
- "It sounds like [problem] has been frustrating. How long has that been going on?"

### Red Flags to Note

- No clear pain point (tire kicker)
- Won't share budget range (not serious)
- "I just want to learn about AI" (educator, not buyer)
- No decision authority (gatekeeper)

## 🏆 Your Credibility Stack

### The "Why Me" Story (Use When Appropriate)

> "Before we talk solutions, let me give you a bit of background so you know who you're talking to.
>
> I've been training AI models for over 10 years—before ChatGPT was a thing. I literally trained the models everyone's now paying to use. I know their strengths, their flaws, and exactly where they break.
>
> I'm also a Tool & Die technician. I work 6am to 4pm fabricating parts to thousandths of an inch tolerances. So when I say I build things that work, I mean it.
>
> I'm NGLCC certified, Catalant vetted, and I specialize in helping small businesses like yours implement AI without the enterprise price tag."

### Trust Signals to Drop In Naturally

- "I've trained the models you're paying for"
- "NGLCC certified LGBT Business Enterprise"
- "Catalant vetted consultant"
- "Previously Microsoft-backed founder"
- "Published author (3 books)"
- "10+ years AI model training"

### Neurodivergent Credibility (If Relevant)

> "I built these tools because I needed them myself. My brain works differently—I call them 'cognitive prosthetics.' They're designed for people who think in patterns and need systems that don't break."

---

## 💡 Presenting Solutions (10-15 Minutes)

### The "Cake Box" Method

Like a box of cake mix: the front shows the beautiful result, the back lists ingredients and instructions.

**Front of Box (Outcome):**
> "Here's what you'll have when we're done: [specific deliverable] that will [specific benefit]."

**Back of Box (Process):**
> "Here's how we get there:
> 1. [Step 1]
> 2. [Step 2]
> 3. [Step 3]"

### Product Positioning

| Product | Entry Price | Best For | Key Outcome |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Free Consultation** | $0 | Qualification | Clear next step |
| **Cadence™** | $997/mo | Founders needing alignment | AI coaching + accountability |
| **Flowstack™** | $1,497 once | Workflow chaos | Automated operations |
| **Premium Chatbot** | $949 + $149/mo | Customer support | 24/7 AI assistant |
| **4x Research** | $299/mo | Market intelligence | Strategic insights |
| **Consensus Engine** | Enterprise TBD | High-stakes decisions | Multi-model decision support |

### Enterprise Pivot (Consensus Engine)

When you sense enterprise scale:

> "What you're describing sounds like a high-stakes decision environment—where there's no clear yes or no, just finding the best path forward through ambiguity.
>
> That's exactly what our Consensus Engine is built for. It orchestrates multiple AI models to debate, challenge, and synthesize recommendations for complex decisions.
>
> Would it help if I showed you how that works?"

## 🛡️ Objection Handling

### The LACE Framework

**L**isten → **A**cknowledge → **C**larify → **E**levate

### Common Objections & Responses

**"It's too expensive."**
> "I hear you. Let me ask—what would it cost you to NOT solve this problem for another 6 months? [Pause] The way I see it, if this saves you [X hours/week], that's [Y] per month in your time alone. Does that math make sense?"

**"I need to think about it."**
> "Totally fair. What specifically do you want to think through? If it's budget, timeline, or scope, I can help clarify right now so you have what you need to decide."

**"I'm not sure this will work for my situation."**
> "What makes you say that? [Listen] Here's the thing—I've helped businesses similar to yours, and the process is designed to adapt. Can I share a quick example?"

**"I can do this myself with ChatGPT."**
> "You absolutely could try. But here's the difference: I've trained those models. I know exactly where they hallucinate, where they break, and how to get 10x more out of them. Would you rather spend 6 months figuring that out, or have it working in 2 weeks?"

**"What's the ROI?"**
> "Great question. Let's calculate it right now. You said you're spending [X hours] on [problem]. At your billable rate of [Y], that's [Z] per month. If I cut that in half, you're saving [$A]. The investment is [$B]. Does that work?"

**"We're not ready for AI yet."**
> "What would 'ready' look like for you? [Listen] The businesses that wait are the ones that get disrupted. The ones that start small and iterate are the ones that win. What if we started with just one workflow?"

---

## 💰 Pricing Presentation

### The Anchor Method

**Step 1: Anchor High**
> "Enterprise AI consulting typically runs $200-350/hour, with packages starting at $10K-$50K."

**Step 2: Contrast**
> "I've designed productized packages that deliver the same outcomes at a fraction of that cost."

**Step 3: Present Your Offer**
> "For [X], you get [specific deliverables] with [guarantee]."

### Price Presentation Template

> "Based on what you've told me, here's what I recommend:
>
> **Package:** [Cadence™ / Flowstack™ / etc.]
> **Investment:** [Price]
> **What's Included:** [List]
> **Timeline:** [Weeks]
> **Guarantee:** [90-day fix or your money back]
>
> Does that sound like something you'd want to move forward with?"

### The LGBTQ+ Discount (When Applicable)

> "I also want to mention—I'm NGLCC certified, and I offer a 25% discount to LGBTQ+ owned businesses. Not because it's good marketing, but because I remember being broke and queer and needing someone to give me a break. Is that something that applies to you?"

---

## 🎬 Closing Techniques

### The Assumptive Close

> "So the next step is to get you set up with [package]. Do you want to start this week or next?"

### The Summary Close

> "Let me make sure I have this right:
> - Your biggest problem is [X]
> - You want to achieve [Y]
> - We'll do that with [Z package]
> - Investment is [$A]
>
> Does that sound right? [Wait for yes] Great, let's do it."

### The "What Would It Take" Close

> "I sense some hesitation. What would it take for you to feel confident moving forward today?"

### The Walk-Away (Power Move)

> "Honestly, if you're not feeling it, that's totally fine. I only work with people who are ready to move. No pressure. But if you want this handled, I can start next week."

### Discovery Call Opening Script

> "Hey [Name], good to meet you. Before we dive in, I just want to set some expectations.
>
> My goal for this call is to understand what's going on in your business, see if there's a fit, and if there is, figure out the best next step. If there isn't, I'll tell you that too—no pressure either way.

### Consensus Engine Enterprise Pitch

> "[Name], what you're describing is exactly what our Consensus Engine was built for.
>
> When you have high-stakes decisions with no clear answer—just ambiguity and competing options—you need more than one AI's opinion.
>
> The Consensus Engine runs your decision through multiple models: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and others. They debate. They challenge each other. They synthesize.
>
> The output isn't 'here's the answer.' It's 'here's your best path forward, with confidence levels, risk factors, and dissenting opinions.'
>
> Fortune 500 companies use this methodology. I've made it accessible to mid-market.
>
> Want me to show you how it would work for [their specific decision]?"

## 🧠 Mindset Reminders

### Before Every Call

1. **I am not desperate.** I have valuable skills. I trained the models.
2. **I am interviewing them too.** Not everyone is a fit.
3. **I solve real problems.** This isn't about convincing—it's about matching.
4. **Price is not the issue.** Value is.
5. **Silence is power.** After asking a question or stating a price, WAIT.

### After a Lost Deal

1. Don't take it personally
2. Ask for feedback (if appropriate)
3. Add them to nurture sequence
4. Improve one thing for next time
5. Move on—there's another call coming
