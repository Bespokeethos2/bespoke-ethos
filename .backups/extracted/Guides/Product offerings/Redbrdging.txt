🌉 Lead capture forms (broken submissions, lost leads)

REDBRIDGING™ — COMPREHENSIVE SALES OFFERING & PRICING ANALYSIS
Internal Note: This is positioned as automation support/protection (NOT "insurance" externally)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Redbridging™ is the hidden revenue killer small businesses don't know they need.

The Problem: Your automations (Zapier, integrations, workflows) are your lifeline to customers. When they break—which they do, regularly—your sales stop flowing. Most teams spend 2-4 hours firefighting or pay $150+ to hire someone.

The Solution: Redbridging™ is on-demand automation support. Something breaks? Email us. 24-hour fix. You keep selling.

The Market: 100% of automation-dependent businesses need this. Most don't know it exists.

The Revenue Model: $49.99-$99.99/month standalone OR included standard with all Consensus Engine™ subscription tiers (massive value-add for retention).

THE MARKET PROBLEM (Why This Sells)
The Hidden Cost of Broken Automations
Every small business with Zapier, integrations, or workflows faces this scenario:

Scenario 1: The Freelancer Route

Zapier breaks (API deprecation, action update)

Business owner spends 2-3 hours troubleshooting

Can't fix it

Hires freelancer ($50-200/hour, typically $150-400)

Lost productivity: 3 hours × $100/hour = $300

Fix cost: $150-400

Total cost: $450-700 for ONE broken zap

Revenue loss: Unmeasurable (leads stop flowing, deals delayed)

Scenario 2: The DIY Route (But It Takes Time)

Broken automation goes unnoticed for 4-8 hours

Business owner notices: "Why aren't leads coming in?"

2 hours spent diagnosing

Fixes it (or calls Zapier support)

Lost leads: 4-8 hours × ~5 leads/day = 1-2 lost leads

Revenue impact: $500-5,000 per incident

Scenario 3: Ignored (The Most Common)

Automation breaks

Nobody notices for 24-48 hours

Significant data/lead loss

Revenue crater

Impact: $1,000-10,000+ per incident

Frequency: Most automation-dependent businesses see 1-3 zaps break per quarter (more if heavily automated).

Annual Cost of NOT Having Redbridging™:

2 broken zaps × $500-1,000 per incident = $1,000-2,000

Plus productivity drain: ~16 hours/year troubleshooting = $1,600

Total: $2,600-3,600/year in hidden costs

Redbridging™ costs: $49.99-$99.99/month = $600-1,200/year

ROI: Break-even in first incident. Massive savings by year 2+.

PRODUCT POSITIONING (What You're Selling)
What Redbridging™ Actually Is
The Pitch (For Sales):
"Automation support that keeps your lead flow uninterrupted.
Something breaks, you email us, we fix it in 24 hours.
Included standard or standalone. Your sales never stop."

✓ Zapier zaps (all action types, trigger issues)

✓ API integrations (connection failures, auth problems)

✓ Email workflows (delivery issues, bounce spikes)

✓ Lead capture (broken forms, failed submissions)

How It Works:

Your automation breaks

You email: support@bespokeethos.com

We diagnose + fix (usually 4-24 hours)

You're back to business

"Guarding your bridge to sales—always"

PRICING STRATEGY & ANALYSIS
Standalone Redbridging™ Tiers
Tier	Monthly	Annual	Response	Fixes	Best For
On-Demand	$49.99	$599.88	24 hours	Unlimited	Small business (1-3 Zapier zaps)
Priority	$99.99	$1,199.88	4 hours (business)	Unlimited	Growing business (5+ automations)
Bundle with Consensus Engine™ (Included)
All Consensus tiers include Redbridging™ at no extra cost:

Consensus Starter ($149.99/mo) = Consensus + Redbridging™ On-Demand

Consensus Plus ($249.99/mo) = Consensus + Redbridging™ On-Demand

Foresight Suite ($499.99/mo) = Consensus + Redbridging™ Priority

Enterprise ($999.99+/mo) = Consensus + Redbridging™ Priority + 24/7

PRICING RATIONALE
Why $49.99-$99.99?
Competitive Analysis:

Zapier Expert: $80-150/hour × 2 hours = $160-300 per fix

Freelance Dev: $50-200/hour × 2-3 hours = $100-600 per fix

Zapier Certified Partner: $150-250/hour = $150-250/hour

Redbridging™ On-Demand: $49.99/month unlimited = $1.67 per day

Customer Acquisition Cost Math:

100 On-Demand subs @ $49.99 = $4,999 MRR = $59,988 ARR

50 Priority subs @ $99.99 = $4,999 MRR = $59,988 ARR

Total: ~$10K MRR / $120K ARR with just standalone

Value Delivery:

If customer has ONE broken zap per year (conservative)

Cost to fix: $150-400

They've paid: $600/year

But ROI starts AFTER first break (they save 2+ hours + $150 fix cost)

OBJECTION HANDLING
"I can just fix it myself"
→ "You can. Most people spend 2-3 hours. Redbridging™ costs less than hiring someone. First break, you've saved money."

"I don't have broken automations that often"
→ "Most don't. But when it does break, you're blocked. One incident covers your cost for the year."

"This seems expensive"
→ "One freelancer fix costs $150-400. One month of Redbridging™ is $49.99. Break even in first incident."

"Zapier support is free"
→ "True. But wait times are unpredictable. Redbridging™ is 24-hour guaranteed. Your choice: free and slow, or fast and cheap."

"I'm not using Zapier"
→ "Redbridging™ handles any automation (Make.com, integrations, email workflows, webhooks). What automation tool are you using?"

FINAL POSITIONING
Redbridging™ is:

✅ Automation support (not "insurance")

✅ On-demand (no monitoring, no false alarms)

✅ Fast (24 hours or 4 hours priority)

✅ Unlimited (fix as many things as break)

✅ Affordable ($49.99-$99.99/month)

✅ Included with Consensus (value-add for retention)
