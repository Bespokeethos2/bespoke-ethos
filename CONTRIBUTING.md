# Contributing to Brutus Intelligence Platform

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines the process and guidelines.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/brutus-intelligence.git
   cd brutus-intelligence
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your API keys
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: All new code must be TypeScript with strict typing
- **No `any` types**: Explicit types required (unless interfacing with untyped libraries)
- **ESLint**: Code must pass `npm run lint` with zero warnings
- **Error Handling**: All API endpoints must have graceful error handling
- **Tests**: Add tests for new API endpoints (`scripts/brutus-test-api.mjs` pattern)

## Page Deployment Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Every page that goes live must meet comprehensive quality standards.

See **[PAGE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./PAGE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)** for complete requirements including:

- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design (320px to desktop)
- ✅ Complete SEO setup (titles, meta, OG tags, alt text)
- ✅ Mandatory FAQ sections (minimum 3 questions)
- ✅ Schema markup (Organization, Breadcrumbs, FAQ, Article/Product)
- ✅ WCAG 2.3 accessibility compliance
- ✅ Lighthouse scores 90+ (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
- ✅ TypeScript/ESLint with zero errors/warnings
- ✅ Full testing on mobile, tablet, and desktop

**Before submitting any page for review**, run:

```bash
# Complete quality check
pnpm run preflight
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm build
pnpm run smoke
pnpm run audit:css

# Deployment quality validation
node scripts/deployment-quality-check.mjs
```

**"Good enough is not good enough. Perfect is the standard."**

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch naming**: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
2. **Commit messages**: Clear, descriptive (e.g., "Add rate limiting to OpenAI endpoint")
3. **Testing**: Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` before submitting
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs (BRUTUS_API.md, README.md, etc.)

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority
- Additional model providers (Claude, Mistral, Cohere)
- Usage analytics dashboard
- Rate limiting per API key
- Webhook support for async tasks
- Fine-tuning pipeline

### Medium Priority
- GraphQL API alternative
- Multi-region deployment guides
- Performance benchmarks
- Additional language SDKs (Python, Go, etc.)

### Low Priority
- UI improvements
- Documentation translations
- Example applications

## Code Review

All contributions will be reviewed by maintainers. We typically respond within 48 hours.

**What we check:**
- Code quality and TypeScript standards
- Security (especially auth/API key handling)
- Performance impact
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage
