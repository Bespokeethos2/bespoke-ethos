Pain Points (Why They Care)
Operational Pain:

Phone ringing constantly (distraction)

Same questions asked 50+ times/day

Customers frustrated with wait times

Manual work stealing time from real business

Financial Pain:

Support staff costs $2K-5K/month

Can't afford to hire 24/7 coverage

Sales lost at night/weekends (nobody to answer)

ROI uncertainty ("Will this actually work?")

Psychology:

Skeptical of AI (doesn't trust automation)

Worried about losing the "human touch"

Balks at upfront costs (would rather pay-as-you-go)

Needs to see the problem it solves IMMEDIATELY

What They Want to Hear
"I don't want to spend $10K on something that might not work. Show me it works first. Then I'll pay monthly."

Translation: Low upfront cost + immediate visible results + no risk

PRODUCT OFFERING: "AI BUSINESS ASSISTANT"
What It Does (In Plain English)
Without Chatbot:
Customer calls: "What are your hours?"
You answer (or they wait on hold)
You stop working to answer
Repeat 50 times/day

With Chatbot:
Customer: "What are your hours?"
Bot: "9am-6pm Monday-Friday, 10am-4pm Saturday"
Customer gets instant answer
You keep working

✅ Qualifies Leads — Bot asks questions, captures email/phone
✅ Handoff to You — Complex questions go to you via email/Slack

POSITIONING: "Your Business Deserves to Be Open 24/7"
The Problem (Stated)
"Most small businesses are open 9-5. But customers don't shop 9-5. They shop at night. On weekends. When you're closed. So they go to your competitor instead."

The Solution (Stated)
"Put a 24/7 assistant on your website. Answers questions while you sleep. Captures leads while you work. Doesn't cost $10K."

The Tagline
"Same Questions. Bot Answers. You Grow." (5 words)

Why it works:

Problem: "Same Questions" (their pain)

Solution: "Bot Answers" (immediate relief)

Benefit: "You Grow" (why they care)

Emotional: Implies growth/success

PRICING STRATEGY (Built for SMB Psychology)
The Pricing Tiers
Tier	Monthly	Annual	Best For	Why Buy
Starter	$49	$490	Solopreneurs, local service (plumbers, consultants)	"I just need to answer the 5 questions everyone asks"
Growth	$99	$990	Small teams, e-commerce, multiple locations	"I need lead capture + analytics + handoff to my team"
Pro	$199	$1,990	Scaling businesses, multiple locations, high volume	"I need everything + integrations + priority support"
Why These Prices Work
$49/month:

Impulse-buyable (under $50, feels like "let's try it")

Saves 1-2 hours/week for solopreneur ($1,000-2,000 value)

ROI obvious by week 1 (phone rings less)

Annual = $588 (less than 1 month of support staff)

$99/month:

For growing businesses (5-20 employees)

Still under "ask forgiveness not permission" approval level

ROI = 1-3 months (savings + leads)

Annual = $1,188 (reasonable for lead capture + support savings)

$199/month:

For scaling/serious businesses

Requires ROI justification (but easy to justify)

Annual = $2,388

Still cheaper than hiring part-time support ($2K/month alone)

Revenue Model Math
Conservative Scenario (Year 1):

50 Starter @ $49/mo = $2,450/mo

30 Growth @ $99/mo = $2,970/mo

15 Pro @ $199/mo = $2,985/mo

Total: $8,405 MRR = $100,860 ARR

With 5% Monthly Churn: ~5-month payback on acquisition cost

Upside Scenario (Word-of-Mouth Growth):

100 Starter @ $49/mo = $4,900/mo

75 Growth @ $99/mo = $7,425/mo

40 Pro @ $199/mo = $7,960/mo

Total: $20,285 MRR = $243,420 ARR

SALES PITCH (For Small Business Owner)
Opening (Problem Identification)
"How many times a day do customers ask you the same questions?"

They answer: "Constantly. Probably 50 times a day."

"And what do you do?"

They answer: "Answer. Or they wait. Or they leave."

"How much time does that cost you?"

They realize: 5-10 hours/week. At $50-100/hour? That's $250-1,000/week. = $13K-52K/year.

The Pivot (To Solution)
"What if those questions answered themselves? 24/7? While you slept?"

Pause. Let them imagine it.

"And the cost? Less than hiring a part-time person. Less than $50/month to start."

Their skepticism: "It won't work. Bots are terrible."

Overcoming Objection
"True. Generic bots are terrible. But we don't give you a generic bot. We teach your bot to talk like you. Answer questions the way you would. It's not 'press 1 for hours, press 2 for pricing.' It's a real conversation. Just automated."

The Close
"Try it free for 14 days. Set it up (takes 30 minutes). See it answer questions. If you hate it, cancel. If it saves you time, pay $49/month. Deal?"

Why this works:

No risk (free trial removes "I'm wasting money" fear)

Effort minimal (30 minutes, not weeks)

Payoff visible immediately (bot answering questions)

Price is low ($49 isn't scary)

Easy to cancel (no commitment fear)

PRICING PSYCHOLOGY (Why SMBs Buy)
The Mental Shift We're Creating
Before: "I can't afford support tech. Custom AI is $50K+."

After: "For $49/month, I can try this. If it works, I keep it. If it doesn't, I cancel."

The Risk Reversal
We're not asking them to risk money.
We're asking them to risk 30 minutes of time.

"30 minutes to set it up" sounds reasonable.
"$50K to build a chatbot" sounds insane.
"$49/month to try" sounds smart.

The Objection Handler
"Will this really work for my business?"

Answer: "What are your top 5 customer questions?"
(They list them)
"The bot can answer those. Instantly. That alone saves hours/week. The rest? Anything it can't handle goes to you. You're protected."

"I don't want to lose the personal touch."

Answer: "You won't. Customers still reach you. The bot just handles the easy stuff first. Imagine it as a secretary screening calls."

"What if the bot gives wrong information?"

Answer: "You train it. You write the answers. We just automate them. It's not making stuff up. It's reading the rules you give it."
