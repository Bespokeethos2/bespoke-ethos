          When you&rsquo;re running a business alone, every big decision feels paralyzing. Should I raise prices? Pivot my messaging? Hire someone? I built Consensus
          Engine™ because I needed a trusted advisor who could see all sides of a problem-without the $10,000 consulting bill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask your biggest strategic question and see a structured debate-four independent perspectives that synthesize a recommendation with reasoning and tradeoffs.
          It&rsquo;s like having a board of advisors in your pocket.
