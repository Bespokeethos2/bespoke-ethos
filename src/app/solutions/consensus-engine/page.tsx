    _title: "How is this different from just asking a single AI model for advice?",

      "Instead of one confident answer, Consensus Engine runs multiple research agents that challenge each other’s assumptions, surface tradeoffs, and then synthesize a recommendation. You see the reasoning, citations, and disagreements—not just a polished paragraph.",

                Most tools give you one model with a single vantage point. Consensus Engine brings several

                modelling—then synthesizes what they find into one decision brief. You see options, evidence,
                tradeoffs, and a recommendation, not just a confident paragraph.

                  You&apos;re not handing your toughest calls to a mystery lab. Consensus Engine is built by an

                  live with the consequences of his own decisions. We start with one big question and earn your trust

                Every free 30-minute consultation comes with one Consensus Engine research brief on a reasonable
                strategic question, so you can see the process before you ever pay for a plan. Many clients then move to
                a single, fixed-price research question or a monthly subscription. LGBTQ-owned businesses receive 25%
                off upfront project fees on approved scopes; subscriptions stay at standard rates. If this level of
                clarity would materially change your trajectory but the price is out of reach, email about our annual

            </Heading>
            <p>
              In Cleveland, there wasn&apos;t a single, trustworthy place for queer folks to see what was happening this
              week. Events were scattered across Instagram posts, flyers, and half-updated websites—which meant people
              often heard about shows and meetups only after they were over.
            </p>
            <p>
              We turned that into a Consensus Engine problem. Three AI research agents went on independent sprints to
              find and verify events. Each agent knew it was competing with two others, would lose points for
              hallucinated or outdated listings, and would earn bonus points for catching bad data from the others. A
              simple scorecard—verified events, faulty events, unique finds—kept the game honest.
            </p>
            <p>
              After several rounds, we promoted the winner&apos;s findings into a verified feed and manually spot-checked
              the riskiest entries. The result is{" "}

                a structured outline of: options, supporting facts, tradeoffs, and a clear &quot;if this, then
                that&quot; recommendation.
