  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-1",
    _title: "How fast can you ship a first automation?",
    answer:
      "Most clients see a production-ready workflow in days, not months. We start with your most painful task, ship a narrow win first, and iterate with you in the loop.",
  },
  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-2",
    _title: "Will I stay in control of approvals?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every build includes human approval checkpoints, clear audit trails, and rollbacks. You decide what runs automatically and what always needs a human click.",
  },
  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-3",
    _title: "Which tools do you work with?",
    answer:
      "Zapier, Make, Airtable, HubSpot, QuickBooks, Google Workspace, and more-plus custom connectors when needed. If you already have tools in place, we start there instead of ripping them out.",
  },
  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-4",
    _title: "Is my data secure?",
    answer:
      "We minimize data exposure, encrypt in transit, and follow least-privilege principles. Sensitive operations can run on your infrastructure, and we avoid storing more data than a workflow truly needs.",
  },
  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-5",
    _title: "Do you replace my team or work with them?",
    answer:
      "We design automations that take the busywork off your team&apos;s plate so they can stay focused on higher-value work. AI handles structured, repeatable tasks; humans still make the calls that matter.",
  },
  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-6",
    _title: "What does a typical first project cost?",
    answer:
      "Most first projects land in the $799-$2,500 range depending on scope. The pricing page breaks down Flowstack™, Chatbots, Consensus Engine™, and Redbridging™ packages, plus one-time services.",
  },
  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-7",
    _title: "Can you rescue broken automations I already have?",
    answer:
      "Yes-that&apos;s exactly what Redbridging™ is for. We stabilize brittle Zapier/Make flows, add monitoring and alerts, and document everything so you&apos;re not dependent on a single person who &quot;knows the system.&quot;",
  },
  {
    _analyticsKey: "faq-8",
    _title: "How do we get started?",
    answer:
      "Book a free assessment or send a quick note through the contact form. Share your top one or two pain points, your tools, and your rough budget. We&apos;ll respond with a concrete plan-not a generic sales deck.",
  },
