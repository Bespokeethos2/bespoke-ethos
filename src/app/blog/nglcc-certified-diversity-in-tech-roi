# NGLCC Certified: Why Diversity in Tech Matters for ROI

Let's be frank, darlings. In the fast-paced world of tech, leaving money on the table is practically a cardinal sin. And if you're not actively fostering diversity and inclusion, specifically by engaging with organizations like the NGLCC (National LGBT Chamber of Commerce), you're likely committing that sin daily. At Bespoke Ethos, we're all about automation that boosts your bottom line, and let me tell you, embracing LGBT inclusion is a powerful engine for ROI.

## Are You Leaving Money on the Table? (Spoiler Alert: You Probably Are)

Think of your company as a finely tuned machine. Each part needs to work in harmony to achieve optimal performance. Now, imagine one of those parts is being intentionally restricted or ignored. That's what happens when you overlook the talent and potential of LGBT individuals.

NGLCC certification isn't just a feel-good badge of honor (although it *is* pretty fabulous). It's a strategic business advantage that unlocks opportunities you might not even know existed.

## Diversity Drives Innovation (And Profits, Honey)

Here's the tea: Diverse teams outperform homogenous ones. Study after study shows it. Why? Because different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds lead to more creative problem-solving and innovative solutions.

Think about it. A team comprised of people from similar backgrounds is likely to approach a challenge in a similar way. A diverse team, however, will bring a range of perspectives to the table, challenging assumptions and sparking new ideas. This is especially crucial in the tech sector, where innovation is the lifeblood of success.

## Attract and Retain Top Talent (Bye Felicia to Turnover!)

Let's face it, the competition for top tech talent is fierce. And today's workforce, particularly younger generations, prioritize working for companies that align with their values. They want to work for organizations that are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Being NGLCC certified signals to prospective employees that your company values and supports LGBT individuals. This can give you a significant edge in attracting and retaining top talent. Plus, a more inclusive workplace leads to higher employee satisfaction, lower turnover, and increased productivity. It's a win-win-win!

## Access a Powerful Network (It's All About Who You Know)

The NGLCC isn't just a certification body; it's a vibrant community of LGBT-owned businesses and allies. By becoming NGLCC certified, you gain access to a powerful network of potential clients, partners, and investors. This network can provide invaluable opportunities for business development and growth.

Imagine connecting with other innovative companies, forging strategic partnerships, and gaining access to funding opportunities specifically designed to support LGBT-owned businesses. That's the power of the NGLCC network.
