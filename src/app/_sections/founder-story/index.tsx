                My First Business Almost Broke Me. AI Saved It.

                Six months into my first business—a publishing house I built from scratch—I was drowning. I was a creator and a storyteller, not a logistics expert or a CRM guru. Every minute felt like an hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                That&rsquo;s when I turned to my five years of experience in AI. I taught an AI to be my second brain, automating the overwhelming tasks that were holding me back. It saved my business.
              </p>
              <p>
                I founded <strong className="text-text-primary dark:text-dark-text-primary">Bespoke Ethos</strong> for one reason: to bring that same relief to fellow entrepreneurs and creators. The power of AI shouldn&rsquo;t be reserved for Fortune 500 companies. It belongs in the hands of small businesses, solo founders, and the teams who actually talk to customers every day.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-primary dark:text-dark-text-primary font-medium">
                I&rsquo;m not just a consultant; I&rsquo;m a guide who has walked this path and can show you the way through, one pragmatic workflow at a time.
