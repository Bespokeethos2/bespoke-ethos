              My First Business Almost Broke Me. AI Saved It.

            <p>
              Six months into my first business—a publishing house I built from scratch—I was drowning. I was a creator and a storyteller, not
              a logistics expert or a CRM guru. Every minute felt like an hour.
            </p>
            <p>
               That&apos;s when I turned to my five years of experience as a human-in-the-loop AI trainer, working with foundational models. I taught an AI to be my second brain, automating the overwhelming tasks
               that were holding me back. It saved my business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I founded <strong className="text-text-primary dark:text-dark-text-primary">Bespoke Ethos</strong> for one reason: to bring that same relief
               to fellow entrepreneurs and creators. With NGLCC certification and approval from Catalant enterprise consulting, I&apos;ve proven that the power of AI shouldn&apos;t be reserved for Fortune 500 companies. It belongs in the hands
              of small businesses, solo founders, and the teams who actually talk to customers every day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-primary dark:text-dark-text-primary font-medium">
               I&rsquo;m not just a consultant; I&rsquo;m a guide who has walked this path and can show you the way through, one pragmatic workflow at a
               time.
