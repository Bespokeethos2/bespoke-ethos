## 1. Our Privacy Commitment

BespokeEthos is an NGLCC-certified, LGBTQ-owned AI consulting firm. We believe privacy is not a legal checkbox—it's a foundational value. We operate on these principles:

- **Your data belongs to you.** We don't own it, broker it, or use it to train public models.
- **Edge-first by design.** We favor local, sovereign AI deployment over cloud-only solutions.
- **Transparency over complexity.** This policy explains what we actually do, not what we legally must say.
