# Agent 2 (Visual Assets) Output

Okay, here are explicit Nano Banana 3 prompts to generate the specified assets, incorporating the Rust Belt/Cleveland theme and adhering to your guidelines:

**Important Notes:**

*   **Experimentation is Key:** These are starting points. You may need to adjust the weighting, add or remove terms, and play with the parameters within Nano Banana to achieve the exact look you envision.
*   **Color Palette Consistency:** Maintain a consistent dark navy and steel gray color palette across all assets for brand cohesion.
*   **Pay attention to the "no pill shapes" constraint.**
*   **Refine prompts that are not working**

**1. Hero Splash:**

*   **Prompt:** `"4K, Dark Navy, hero splash image. Intricate wireframe model of the Cleveland skyline seamlessly merging with a glowing, abstract AI neural network. Data points visualizing city landmarks like the Terminal Tower and steel bridges flicker within the AI connections. Steel gray gradient backdrop, depth of field. Photorealistic 3D render, high detail, dramatic lighting."`

**2. Blog Thumbnails (8 Prompts - each tailored to the topic - here are examples. Customize these!):**

*   **General Structure:** `"[Blog Topic Descriptor]. Concrete, photorealistic image of a diverse professional [Profession] using AI-powered technology in a [Office or Industrial] setting. Subtle Cleveland industrial architecture details in the background (e.g., exposed brick, steel beams, glimpse of a bridge through a window). [Describe AI integration, e.g., augmented reality display, data visualization on a screen]. Photorealistic 3D render, shallow depth of field, focus on the professional, steel and navy color palette. No pill shapes."`

    *   **Example 1 (AI in Manufacturing):** `"AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance. Concrete, photorealistic image of a diverse industrial engineer using AI-powered augmented reality to inspect machinery on a factory floor. Subtle glimpses of Cleveland's steel mills in the background. Augmented reality display overlaying data on the machinery, highlighting potential issues. Photorealistic 3D render, shallow depth of field, focus on the engineer, steel and navy color palette. No pill shapes."`
    *   **Example 2 (AI in Finance):** `"AI-Driven Investment Strategies. Concrete, photorealistic image of a diverse financial analyst using AI-powered data visualization tools in a modern office. The background should show a subtle silhouette of the Terminal Tower in the data points on the screen. Clean, modern office environment, focus on the analyst, steel and navy color palette. No pill shapes."`
    *   **Example 3 (AI in Healthcare):** `"AI-Assisted Diagnostics. Concrete, photorealistic image of a diverse doctor using AI-powered software to analyze a medical scan on a display. Subtle elements of old factory buildings converted into hospitals in the background. Steel and navy color palette. No pill shapes."`

    *   **REMEMBER: Create six more prompts for your remaining blog topics.**

**3. Service Cards (4 Prompts):**

*   **General Structure:** `"Square service card for [Service Name]. Abstract representation of [Service Name Concept] using elements of AI and Cleveland's industrial landscape. Focus on interconnected networks, data streams, and subtle steel and wireframe textures. Dark Navy and steel gradient background. Photorealistic 3D render, high detail, glowing accents, clean design. No pill shapes."`

    *   **Cadence:** `"Square service card for Cadence. Abstract representation of iterative AI model using elements of connected data streams and wireframes. Focus on interconnected networks, data streams, and subtle steel and wireframe textures. Dark Navy and steel gradient background. Photorealistic 3D render, high detail, glowing accents, clean design. No pill shapes."`
    *   **Consensus:** `"Square service card for Consensus. Abstract representation of merging data networks and the Terminal Tower silhouette in an AI network. Focus on interconnected networks, data streams, and subtle steel and wireframe textures. Dark Navy and steel gradient background. Photorealistic 3D render, high detail, glowing accents, clean design. No pill shapes."`
    *   **Skyway:** `"Square service card for Skyway. Abstract representation of connected systems using elements of AI and the hope for the future. Focus on interconnected networks, data streams, and subtle steel and wireframe textures. Dark Navy and steel gradient background. Photorealistic 3D render, high detail, glowing accents, clean design. No pill shapes."`
    *   **Consult:** `"Square service card for Consult. Abstract representation of expert assistance using elements of AI and the Terminal Tower. Focus on interconnected networks, data streams, and subtle steel and wireframe textures. Dark Navy and steel gradient background. Photorealistic 3D render, high detail, glowing accents, clean design. No pill shapes."`

**4. Trust Badges (4 Prompts):**

*   **General Structure:** `"Trust Badge: [Badge Name]. Circular badge with glowing elements and subtle AI integration. Incorporate [Specific Visual Element related to the badge]. Dark Navy and Steel gray color palette, high detail, photorealistic 3D render, glowing border. No pill shapes."`

    *   **NGLCC:** `"Trust Badge: NGLCC Certified. Circular badge with glowing NGLCC logo integrated with subtle AI circuitry patterns. Dark Navy and steel gray color palette, high detail, photorealistic 3D render, glowing border. No pill shapes."`
    *   **5-Year AI Vet:** `"Trust Badge: 5-Year AI Veteran. Circular badge with glowing number '5' interwoven with an AI neural network symbol. Dark Navy and steel gray color palette, high detail, photorealistic 3D render, glowing border. No pill shapes."`
