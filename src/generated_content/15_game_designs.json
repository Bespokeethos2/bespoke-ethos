    "component_specs": "A central 'dashboard' displays sector health (represented by bars filling up). Players drag and drop AI 'bricks' from a resource pool onto sectors. Successful allocation increases sector health; poor allocation decreases it. Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions and satisfying feedback when resources are assigned.

    "mechanic_description": "A slider-based optimization game where the player adjusts various administrative levers (automation level, marketing spend, HR processes) to minimize 'waste' (represented by animated money flowing down the screen). Finding the optimal balance results in a 'profit surge'.",
    "component_specs": "Several horizontal sliders control different administrative areas. As sliders are adjusted, a counter displays real-time waste and profit figures. Use Framer Motion for smooth slider movement and visual feedback (e.g., a small particle effect for 'profit surge'). Navy background with teal sliders and coral accents. When the user finds the best balance and reduces waste, gold particles should shoot from the center of the sliders."

    "mechanic_description": "A clicker/idle game where the player starts with a single 'virtual sales agent' (represented by an icon) and earns 'leads' (points) with each click. Players can then invest leads to upgrade their sales agent, automate tasks, and unlock new sales channels (represented by additional icons).",
    "component_specs": "A central button to 'Generate Leads'. A sidebar displays available upgrades (e.g., 'Faster Clicks', 'Automated Follow-up', 'Social Media Integration'). Players spend leads to purchase upgrades. Use Framer Motion for subtle animations (e.g., icon pulsing when it's generating leads).

    "mechanic_description": "Players strategically stack blocks representing different diverse suppliers. Each block represents a specific advantage (e.g., innovation, market access, community impact). The higher the stack and the more diverse it is, the higher the ROI score. A poorly balanced stack topples, resulting in a lower score and emphasizing the importance of thoughtful supplier selection.",

    "mechanic_description": "The game presents a seemingly simple visual interface built with a 'no-code' tool. Players must click on elements to reveal the underlying lines of code that enable the functionality. The goal is to 'crack' the interface by uncovering all the hidden code segments within a time limit. Successfully cracking the code exposes the myth that no-code means *no* code, highlighting the layers of abstraction and the importance of understanding foundational coding principles.",

They must drag and drop the points to create the most efficient route. The game calculates the distance and associated costs. Additional challenges include factors like traffic (represented by dynamically appearing obstacles), fuel costs (represented by a depleting bar), and delivery time targets. The player's score is based on minimizing costs, maximizing on-time deliveries, and efficiency. Success highlights the real-world applications of AI-driven route optimization.",

    "mechanic_description": "A sliding scale game where the player adjusts a lever between 'Predictive' and 'Generative' AI to forecast a series of events (e.g., website traffic, sales leads). The closer the player's prediction is to the actual outcome (revealed after the slider is set), the more points they score. Events become increasingly complex, requiring a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each AI approach.",
    "component_specs": "React component with a sliding input range. Framer Motion for smooth transitions and feedback animations. Particle effects for successful predictions (e.g., coral-colored sparks). Scoreboard display. Teal slider with dark navy background. Small text snippets pop up to explain why their choice succeeded or failed based on differences between predictive and generative models."

The player is presented with a series of scenarios related to business decisions (e.g., investing in new tech, adapting to market trends). Each choice has consequences, represented by a 'Future-Proofing Score' (FPS). The goal is to reach 2030 with a high FPS, indicating successful future-proofing. Choices should reflect integration tasks.",
    "component_specs": "React component with clickable buttons representing different choices. Framer Motion for animated transitions between scenarios.

One image shows a successful implementation, the other a failed one due to factors like poor data, lack of maintenance, or inadequate training. The player must click on the differences within a time limit. Each correct spot clicked gives +1 pt and each failure to click the spot in the allotted time deducts 1 pt. Points awarded reflect common mistakes in automation processes outlined in the research. The final score highlights successful or failed automation efforts.",
    "component_specs": "React component with image overlay and clickable areas. Framer Motion for highlighting differences and providing feedback. Dark navy background with teal and coral accents for highlighting selected areas. Timer display. Scoreboard display. The final message indicates which area failed and how the process could improve."

Levels represent different AI decision processes (e.g., loan application, hiring process). Choosing the correct intervention minimizes bias and maximizes fairness. Incorrect choices lead to cascading ethical failures visualized through darker colors and particle effects. Sound cues provide feedback on correct/incorrect interventions.",
    "component_specs": "Framer Motion for cascading elements. React Context for managing game state (score, intervention points). Styled Components for dark navy/teal/coral theme. Use of `useMotionValue` and `useTransform` hooks to control the movement and styling of the cascading elements based on user input. A simple scoring system (displayed in the top right corner) which updates based on correct/incorrect intervention selections."

    "mechanic_description": "A slider-based game where the player controls the parameters of an AI algorithm (e.g., accuracy vs. bias, efficiency vs. privacy). Each slider affects multiple metrics: profit, societal impact, ethical score. The goal is to find the optimal balance within a time limit. The game visually represents the trade-offs through animated charts and data visualizations in a Bespoke Ethos style. A failure state occurs when the player prioritizes profit excessively at the expense of ethics, displayed with a 'moral bankruptcy' screen.",
    "component_specs": "React Hooks for slider state management. Framer Motion for smooth slider animations and data visualizations. Styled Components for the dark navy/teal/coral theme.

Different resource combinations result in different AI outputs (visualized with generative art). If the player chooses bad data or doesn't provide enough computing power the seed withers. The goal is to achieve a thriving, beneficial AI solution. Clicking on the seed provides a brief description of the AI's current state and impact.",
