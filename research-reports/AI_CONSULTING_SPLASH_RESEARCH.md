## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS: What Works for AI Consulting Hero/Splash Pages

### 1. CLARITY IS KING (Sources: willfrancis.com, prismic.io, nudgenow.com)
- **Immediately answer:** "What's in it for me?"
- Answer 3 core questions above the fold:
  1. Who do you serve?
  2. What problem do you solve?
  3. What outcome/transformation do you deliver?
- **AVOID jargon** - people form trust opinions in MILLISECONDS

### 2. HUMAN-FOCUSED VISUALS (Sources: neilpatel.com, hype4.academy, bayleafdigital.com)
- **Human faces** looking toward CTA attract attention
- **Show real people** - NOT abstract tech patterns
- "Promised Land" images = visualizing desired outcomes (freedom, success, relief)
- Professional headshots of founder/team humanize the brand
- **Quality over stock** - authentic > polished fake

### 3. EMOTIONAL DESIGN - NOT TECH DESIGN (Sources: designstudiouiux.com, bluegiftdigital.com)
- Connect on EMOTIONAL level first, logical second
- The "survival brain" asks: Is this relevant to ME?
- The "emotional brain" asks: Do I feel understood?
- Then logic: What's the next step?
- **Feeling of relief, freedom, extra time** = outcome visualization

### 4. SOCIAL PROOF HIERARCHY (Sources: klientboost.com, trustugc.com, webstacks.com)
**Most Effective (in order):**
1. Video testimonials with client faces
2. Case studies with SPECIFIC metrics/ROI
3. Client logos (recognizable brands)
4. Written testimonials with photo + title + company
5. Star ratings from Google/third-party
6. Media mentions ("As seen in...")
7. Awards and certifications

### 5. CTA PSYCHOLOGY (Sources: userpilot.com, apexure.com, hubspot.com)
- **ONE primary CTA** - reduce decision fatigue
- Action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Book", "Discover"
- **Trust cues nearby:** "No credit card required", "Free 15-min call"
- Button color: Should contrast background (emerald on dark = yes)
- Repeat CTA multiple times down page

### 6. HERO SECTION STRUCTURE (Sources: saaswebsites.com, marketermilk.com, everything.design)
**Optimal layout:**
```
[HEADLINE - 8 words max, speaks to pain/outcome]
[SUBHEAD - 1-2 sentences context]
[CTA BUTTON] [SECONDARY LINK]
[TRUST SIGNALS: logos or "500+ businesses helped"]
```

**Hero Image Types That Convert:**
- **Promised Land:** Show the outcome (person relaxing, business thriving)
- **Process:** Show the journey from chaos → order
- **Metaphor:** Visual that represents transformation

### 7. AVOID THESE KILLERS (Sources: Daniel James Consulting, knapsackcreative.com)
❌ Abstract tech patterns (cold, impersonal)
❌ Stock photos of fake diverse teams
❌ Jargon-heavy headlines ("AI-powered synergy solutions")
❌ Multiple competing CTAs
❌ No social proof above the fold
❌ Slow loading images
❌ No faces visible

### 8. MOBILE-FIRST (Sources: heyflow.com, bayleafdigital.com, htmlburger.com)
- 60%+ traffic is mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px)
- Fast load (< 3 seconds)
- Headline must work in 1-2 lines on mobile
- Image should crop gracefully

## 🖼️ IDEAL HERO IMAGE FOR BESPOKE ETHOS

Based on research, the perfect hero should show:

**OPTION A - "The Promised Land":**
- Business owner looking relaxed, extra time on hands
- Outdoor café, morning coffee, laptop closed
- Golden hour, warm lighting
- Body language: relief, confidence, ease
- NOT posed - candid moment of freedom

**OPTION B - "The Transformation":**
- Before/after split
- Left: stressed entrepreneur at desk, papers everywhere
- Right: same person relaxed, organized, smiling

**OPTION C - "Human Connection":**
- Consultant (YOU) talking with happy client
- Candid, laughing, collaborative vibe
- Real relationship, not stock handshake

**COLOR OVERLAY STRATEGY:**
- Apply brand overlay (navy/emerald gradient)
- Keeps image human but integrates with palette
- 40-55% opacity for readability
- Gradient from bottom for text placement

## ✅ ACTION ITEMS FOR BESPOKE ETHOS

1. **Replace abstract hero** with human lifestyle photo
2. **Simplicfy headline** - speak to pain ("Drowning in admin?")
3. **Add social proof strip** under hero (client logos or "500+ hrs saved")
4. **Single CTA** - "Book Your Free Strategy Call"
5. **Add founder face** near CTA for trust
6. **Test**: "Learn More" secondary link for cold traffic
