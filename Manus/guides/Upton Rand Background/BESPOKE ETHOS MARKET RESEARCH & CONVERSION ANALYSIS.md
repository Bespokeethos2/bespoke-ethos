## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION RESEARCH

### Landing Page Best Practices (2025):
1. **Hero Section Must Have:**
   - Clear headline (problem + solution)
   - Subheadline (how it works)
   - Primary CTA (one action only)
   - Trust badge or social proof
   - Hero image showing outcome, not process

2. **Above-the-Fold Priority:**
   - Value proposition (3 seconds to understand)
   - Who it's for (qualification)
   - Primary CTA (contrast color, action verb)
   - Trust signal (certification, client logos)

3. **Pricing Section:**
   - Show at least starting prices
   - Package comparison table
   - "Most Popular" badge on mid-tier
   - Money-back guarantee if applicable

4. **Social Proof Placement:**
   - Testimonials with photo + company
   - Specific results (saved X hours/week)
   - Video testimonials > text
   - Place after value prop, before pricing

5. **CTA Strategy:**
   - Primary: "Start Free Assessment"
   - Secondary: "See Pricing"
   - Tertiary: "Book a Call"
   - Repeat primary CTA every 2 scrolls

## MCP CONNECTOR ADVANTAGES (For Manus, not Codex)
