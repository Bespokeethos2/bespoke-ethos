# AGENT 1 – Research Findings (Summary)

**Scope:** Competitive landscape, Cleveland small‑business market, positioning inputs for design/copy.  
**Source of truth:** `Manus/1-research-agent-COMPLETE.md` + external research already incorporated into the sprint.

---

## Market Highlights

- ~227 active startups in the Cleveland ecosystem with ~$1.6–1.7B tech startup impact (2023–2024).
- ~25% of local small businesses operating in “survival mode”; ~46% underperforming expectations.
- Rising costs/inflation are a primary constraint; automation must be framed as time + cost relief.
- Active grant and support ecosystem (e.g., Southeast Side Promise, local SBDC/SCORE, university hubs).
- Strong fit for “weekend warriors” audience: founders working day jobs and building at night.

## Competitive Landscape (Condensed)

- **Direct automation platforms:** Zapier, Make, n8n, Lindy, Vellum – strong technically, skew enterprise, rarely local or LGBTQ‑visible.
- **Adjacent tools:** Airtable, Monday, ClickUp, Notion – excellent UX and onboarding; inspiration for flows and empty states.
- **Design benchmarks:** Stripe, Linear, Framer, Webflow – modern, performant, subtle motion; used as reference for 2025‑level polish.
- **Differentiators for Bespoke Ethos:**
  - NGLCC‑certified, LGBTQ+‑owned; explicit 25% upfront discount for LGBTQ+ businesses.
  - Cleveland‑first narrative and imagery (skyline, local businesses, grants context).
  - Fixed‑price, small‑business‑friendly offers rather than enterprise “contact sales”.
  - AI‑native workflows (Consensus Engine™, Flowstack™, Redbridging™) rather than generic automation.
