# My Higher Power Has Moss in Its Hair: Spiritual Entrepreneurship

-A moment in time with Upton Rand

I don’t use the word “God” much anymore. Not out of defiance—more like accuracy. The thing that steadies me doesn’t feel like a man in the sky making lists. It feels like a system with bark for skin and fog for breath. Call it the spirit of the forest: not a deity that demands worship, but a patient intelligence that keeps its own ledger in rings and roots. It doesn’t hand out rules; it runs experiments. Light plus water plus time equals life. Decay equals fuel. The understory takes notes while we panic. When I’m there, the meter of my life syncs to something older and calmer. It doesn’t promise outcomes. It nudges me into honest inputs.

Recently I walked into one of those input moments. I’d met a man I wasn’t sure about—good company, new chemistry, the kind of beginning that makes you either hopeful or suspicious depending on your sleep. Two horizons kept flickering in front of me. One was the path Max (my small four-legged foreman) and I have been traveling alone for years. The other was crimson and crowded with ifs. Back home we’ve been neck-deep in finance and forecasting. The nerd in me can say, hand on heart, that after assembling some of the smartest models and cleanest data we can wrangle, I’m ninety-five percent confident we’ll be fine in five years. That’s not prophecy; that’s risk-adjusted optimism. But life doesn’t file quarterly reports, and spreadsheets can’t hold the temperature of your chest at dawn.

We went to the campground. I told myself—same way I told myself the first time I went to write the book—that this would be just a normal trip. No whispers from ancient oak gods. Just coffee, laughter, maybe a flirtation that could turn into something. The forest usually responds to that kind of planning by shrugging and showing me what’s real.

Six a.m., the campground still breathing in its sleep, I slipped into the trees with Max—he goes everywhere with me, a small, steady metronome at the end of the leash. The gentleman I’d brought was still in our bed, a warm absence I could feel even out here. The path was damp and quiet; my breath and the crunch of twigs were the whole soundtrack. Then the tingle started—the kind that begins at the base of the skull and radiates forward, like some inner antenna catching a signal. Dawn didn’t break so much as lift: darkness unhooked from the branches, and a pale warmth began to gather low in the east. Fog moved through the understory with intention, pooling in hollows, then rolling—real rolling, bales of cotton pushed by a temperature inversion—while dew stitched the ferns into a wet embroidery. Half of what I felt was physics doing what physics does: warmer air gliding over cold ground, vapor condensing on dust and pollen, light getting ready to scatter. The other half was the privilege of being the only witness. No footsteps but mine, no murmurs from cabins, no coffee burbling in someone else’s kitchen. Just me and Max watching a meadow become a cathedral. When the sun’s first edge finally shouldered up, its light shattered across a billion suspended droplets and threw a starburst so clean it felt like a bell—diffraction turning moisture into a crown. In that strike of brightness I knew the moment would vanish before anyone else woke, dissolving back into ether, and that was the spell: a private proof that the world still makes new things when no one is looking. I took a photo for the record, but the record isn’t the point. The point is the message the forest pressed into me as surely as a thumbprint: you’re here, you’re listening, choose your road without flinching.

In that light, two roads rose—my brain rendered them like planks hovering in fog. Left was a city I recognize ten years from now, not fantasy but the street grid of what happens if we keep building what we’re building at Gay Men’s Field Guide: tools deployed, people helped, our weirdo creativity turned into useful architecture. Right was softer, blurrier, a detour I know too well: trying to date in a way that asks my work to quiet down, to be small, to be “just a job” while my heart knocks on the inside of my ribs with a wrench. I don’t blame anyone who wanted me to be easier. They were asking for a version of me I sometimes dream about: reachable, relaxed, phone face down.

Here’s the brutal arithmetic I keep relearning: being early is thrilling and lonely in the same breath. You see around corners and you talk to people about rooms that don’t exist yet. You pin paper to the wall and call it a blueprint while everyone else calls it cute. Then one day a door appears exactly where you said it would and suddenly you’re a visionary instead of a nuisance. The whiplash is humbling. It’s also addictive. The models we build keep confirming the patterns; the patterns keep turning into reality with satisfying clicks. That’s not magic; that’s curiosity plus a willingness to look dorky until it matters. But there is a cost. You are, more often than not, first to the party. The snacks are still sealed. The playlist is on a loop. You invent small talk with destiny while the room fills.

I’ve comforted myself by borrowing big names—Da Vinci, Descartes—“my people,” I joke, not because I’m them, but because they knew the ache of being early. Their legacies are mixed and human; sainthood isn’t the point. The point is process. They flipped puzzle pieces until the picture held. Innovation is a stubborn faith in a partial image, and then, when the edges lock, the click ricochets through your bones.

Back to the man sleeping in our bed: he’s not a villain. He didn’t ask to be edited into my map. He didn’t ask to hike at my pace. The most loving sentence I can offer sometimes is the one that ends a fantasy gently. Not everyone needs to walk the left road. Not everyone should. The forest doesn’t negotiate. It shows structure and leaves you alone with your appetite.

And appetite is where sobriety lives for me. I got sober in 2015, and the forest has been the one place that consistently hands me clarity without a hangover. The clarity isn’t a spotlight; it’s more like when the static drops out of a radio and the song gets clean. Scientific spiritual. Reverence without superstition. Chlorophyll doing the most competent job on earth while I pretend I’m in charge. Mycelium whispering beneath my feet, passing sugars and warnings from tree to tree. Photosynthesis conducting the choir. The facts don’t kill the wonder; they concentrate it.

We made a call at the Guide. Keep the shirts, keep the blog, keep the welcome mat out. And double down on the work that lives a little ahead of where most folks are comfortable walking. Our future is in the future. It sounds cheeky until you realize it’s a boundary. We’re not a church; we’re a workshop. We don’t need converts. We need collaborators and the occasional skeptic who will test a beam and tell us if it holds. That’s part of what makes LGBTQ spaces like a gay campground holy to me: they are laboratories of belonging. You bring the version of yourself the world said was “too much” or “not enough,” and the forest looks at you, shrugs, and makes room.

This is where the common ground comes in, because none of this is exclusively queer or tech or “people who schedule sunrise walks with their pug” content. Everyone I know—gay, straight, bi, ace; loud, quiet; spreadsheet believer, improviser—has stood at a personal trailhead and squinted at two paths. One was safe and legible. One looked like them. Sometimes they’re the same path (lucky). Often they’re not. The friction is universal. Family expectations. Rent. Grief. The dull ache of wanting to be loved without negotiating away the part of you that keeps you alive. The forest won’t solve it for you. It just removes the static so you can hear your own signal.

What did I choose? The same thing I always choose when I’m not trying to be someone easier: the work that feels like love. Not the capital-R Relationship (though if someone shows up at my pace with snacks and good shoes, I’ll scoot over). I mean the love that crackles when I’m building, writing, training models, turning thumbnails on glass into portals. It’s being first at the party with a mop and a playlist and faith the room will fill. It’s knowing I might walk through the same pane of glass a hundred times to reach the next room, and calling the cuts the price of admission.

I looked at the photo later—the starburst everyone will assume is a filter—and I heard the forest say: these are the tools of creation. Not “you are chosen,” but “you are responsible.” If you can see a pattern, test it. If you can open a door, don’t make it heavier than it needs to be. If you love something, move toward it without apologizing to your past. That’s not easy. It’s not even consistently rewarding in the short term. But it’s the only way I’ve found to keep loneliness from curdling into bitterness. Early can be lonely; so can late. The cure isn’t timing. It’s alignment.

To the man I brought: thank you for the experiment and the kindness of being exactly who you are. To anyone reading who doesn’t speak gay campground or startup or sobriety: you have a forest version too. Maybe it’s a kitchen at five a.m. before the baby wakes, when the house is a chapel of humming appliances and your coffee decides today is survivable. Maybe it’s a lake that ignores your emails. Maybe it’s a garage full of stubborn motors, a trail you run until your thoughts line up, a sanctuary pew, a library carrel, the inside of a song. Find the place where the noise lets go of your throat. Stand there. Let physics and patience make the air weird. If you’re very lucky—and luck is real—two paths will rise and you’ll know which one you’ve been on all along.

I won’t pretend that choosing once means choosing forever. The forest doesn’t hand out diplomas. It hands out practice. Tomorrow I’ll forget. I’ll get anxious and loud and fall in love with a detour shaped like validation. Then I’ll go back—maybe with Max tugging at the leash, maybe alone—and start the experiment again. The spirit of the forest isn’t a judge; it’s a lab. It is haunted and beautiful because life is haunted and beautiful. We’re here for a moment, and the earth will reuse us generously when we’re done. That fact chills me in the best way. It makes me want to spend my limited hours building a city I can recognize, even if I’m the first one inside, lights half on, music loading. The door’s open. If it’s your road too, you’ll find it. If it isn’t, I hope you find yours and walk it without flinching. Either way, may the fog roll, may the starburst catch, and may the truth be kind enough to arrive early.
