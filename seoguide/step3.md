# Finding Your First Clients
## The Step-by-Step Guide for Someone Who's Never Done Sales

---

## What This Document Is

This is not a sales strategy. This is a script for finding people who will pay you money.

It tells you:
- Who to talk to
- What to say (exact words)
- What to do when they say yes
- What to do when they say no
- What to do when you freeze

## The Truth About Getting Clients

**How it actually works:**

You reach out to 20 people → 5 respond → 2 take a call → 1 becomes a client

That's normal. That's not failure. That's the math.

**The two types of clients you're going after:**

1. **Small businesses (SMBs)** — Owner-operators, no HR department, no procurement process, no background checks. They hire you because they trust you.

2. **Corporate/supplier diversity** — Big companies with diversity programs looking for LGBTQ-owned vendors. More money, more process, more time.

**Start with SMBs.** They're faster, simpler, and build your testimonial library for bigger fish later.

---

## TRACK 1: PEOPLE YOU ALREADY KNOW

This is the fastest path to your first client.

---

### Step 1: Make The List

**THE ACTION:**
Open your phone contacts. Open Facebook. Open LinkedIn. Open your memory.

Write down names of people who:
- Own a business (any size, any kind)
- Manage operations or admin at a company
- Have complained about being overwhelmed
- You haven't completely burned a bridge with

**AIM FOR:** 10-20 names

**GRAY AREA:**
"But I don't know anyone." You know more people than you think. Former coworkers. Church members. People from recovery. Neighbors. That guy you talked to at karaoke. The person who cuts your hair. Anyone who owns or runs anything.

---

### Step 2: The Referral Ask (Text or DM)

You're not selling them anything. You're asking if they know someone.

**WHAT TO SEND:**

---

**COPY THIS:**

> Hey [Name], hope you're doing well. Quick question — I'm building an AI consulting practice helping businesses automate repetitive work. Do you know anyone drowning in admin stuff who might want to chat? Happy to do a free 30-min call to see if AI could help. No pressure either way, just putting feelers out.

---

**SEND TO:** 5-10 people from your list

**WHEN TO SEND:** Weekday, not early morning or late night

**WHAT HAPPENS:**
- Some won't respond (that's fine)
- Some will say "not really" (say "no worries, thanks!")
- Some will say "actually, I might be interested" (see Step 4)
- Some will say "my friend [Name] might be" (see Step 3)

---

### Step 3: If They Give You A Name

**WHAT TO SAY:**

> That's great! Would you mind introducing us? Even just a quick text saying "hey my friend Upton does AI stuff, you should talk to him" would help a ton.

**WHY:**
A warm intro converts 10x better than cold outreach. You want them to send the first message, not you.

**IF THEY WON'T INTRO BUT GIVE YOU THE NAME:**

> No problem. Mind if I reach out and mention you suggested I contact them?

Then send:

> Hi [Name], [Mutual Friend] suggested I reach out. I help small businesses automate repetitive work using AI. They mentioned you might be dealing with [whatever they said]. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I could help?

---

### Step 4: If They're Interested Themselves

**WHAT TO SAY:**

> Great! Let's do a quick call — 30 minutes, no charge — and I'll look at your workflow and tell you honestly if AI could help. If it can, I'll put together a simple proposal. If it can't, I'll tell you that too. No pressure either way.
>
> What times work for you this week?

**IF YOU HAVE A SCHEDULING LINK:**
> Here's my calendar — pick any time that works: [link]

---

## TRACK 2: LINKEDIN OUTREACH

This is for finding people you don't know.

---

### Step 5: Fix Your LinkedIn First

Before you reach out to anyone, make sure your profile doesn't confuse them.

**YOUR HEADLINE (the text under your name):**

> AI Consultant | Helping Small Businesses Automate Operations | NGLCC Certified | Cleveland

**YOUR ABOUT SECTION:**

---

**COPY THIS:**

> I help small business owners get their time back.
>
> After years training AI systems (including work with models used by millions of people), I saw how powerful these tools could be for everyday businesses—not just tech giants.
>
> Now I help Cleveland-area companies automate the repetitive stuff: admin work, customer follow-up, scheduling, data entry. The things that eat your day but don't grow your business.
>
> If you're spending 10+ hours a week on tasks that feel like they should be automatic, let's talk.
>
> NGLCC Certified LGBT Business Enterprise
> Free 30-minute AI consultation available

---

---

### Step 6: Post Once Per Week

You don't need to go viral. You need to exist.

**POST FORMAT THAT WORKS:**

1. Hook (first line that makes people stop scrolling)
2. Short story or observation (3-5 sentences)
3. Takeaway or question
4. Call to action (optional)

**EXAMPLE POST:**

---

**COPY AND EDIT:**

> Most small businesses are drowning in admin work they think they just have to live with.
>
> Scheduling. Follow-ups. Data entry. Copying information from one system to another.
>
> I spent years training the AI systems millions of people use every day. Now I help small businesses use those same tools to cut their admin time in half.
>
> If you're spending more than 10 hours a week on repetitive tasks, there's probably a way to automate it.
>
> DM me "time" if you want to find out what's possible.

---

**WHEN TO POST:**
Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday morning (8-10 AM) gets the most visibility.

**WHAT TO EXPECT:**
Your first few posts will get almost no engagement. That's normal. Keep posting. Consistency matters more than any single post.

---

### Step 7: LinkedIn Direct Outreach

Find people who might need you. Send them a message.

**WHO TO SEARCH FOR:**
- "Operations Manager Cleveland"
- "Small Business Owner Ohio"
- "Office Manager Cleveland"
- "Founder Cleveland"
- "Manufacturing Manager Northeast Ohio"

**HOW MANY TO CONTACT:**
5-10 per week. Not per day—you don't have time for that.

**THE MESSAGE:**

---

**COPY THIS:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> I came across your profile and saw you're [their title] at [company]. I'm curious — are you dealing with any repetitive tasks that eat up more time than they should?
>
> I help small businesses automate workflows using AI. Not the complicated enterprise stuff — practical solutions that actually save time.
>
> If that sounds relevant, I'm happy to chat for 15 minutes and share what I've seen work. No pitch, just a conversation.
>
> Either way, nice to connect.
>
> — Upton

---

**WHAT HAPPENS:**
- Most won't respond (normal)
- Some will connect but not reply (that's fine—they see your posts now)
- Some will say "not interested" (say "no problem, thanks for responding")
- Some will say "tell me more" (move to Step 8)

---

### Step 8: When Someone Says "Tell Me More"

**WHAT TO SAY:**

> Happy to share more. The quick version: I help businesses automate repetitive tasks—things like data entry, follow-ups, scheduling, report generation. Usually saves 5-15 hours per week depending on the workflow.
>
> The easiest way to figure out if it applies to you is a quick call. I can ask a few questions about your current processes and tell you honestly if AI could help—and if not, I'll tell you that too.
>
> Want to find 20 minutes this week?

**IF THEY SAY YES:**
Schedule the call. See "The Discovery Call" section below.

**IF THEY GO QUIET:**
Follow up once in 3-4 days:
> Just bumping this up — still happy to chat if useful. If now's not a good time, no worries at all.

Then let it go. Don't follow up more than twice.

---

## THE DISCOVERY CALL

This is where you find out if they're a real client or just curious.

---

### Step 9: Before The Call

**PREPARE:**
- Look at their LinkedIn profile
- Look at their company website (if they have one)
- Write down 2-3 questions specific to their business

**MINDSET:**
You're not selling. You're diagnosing. Your job is to understand their problem, not pitch your solution.

---

### Step 10: The Call Structure (30 minutes max)

**MINUTE 0-2: Small talk**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. How's your day going?"

Keep it short. You're both busy.

**MINUTE 2-5: Set the frame**
> "So here's what I was thinking for today — I'll ask you some questions about your current workflow to see if AI automation makes sense for your situation. If it does, I'll explain what that could look like. If it doesn't, I'll tell you honestly. Sound good?"

**MINUTE 5-20: Ask questions and listen**

The magic questions:
1. "Walk me through a typical day/week. What takes up most of your time?"
2. "What's the most annoying repetitive task you do?"
3. "If you could wave a magic wand and automate one thing, what would it be?"
4. "How much time do you spend on [thing they mentioned] per week?"
5. "What happens if this doesn't get fixed? What's the cost of continuing as-is?"

**LISTEN MORE THAN YOU TALK.** Take notes. Let them vent.

**MINUTE 20-25: Reflect back what you heard**
> "So if I'm hearing you right, you're spending about [X hours] per week on [task], and it's causing [problem]. Is that accurate?"

**MINUTE 25-30: Next steps**
If there's a fit:
> "Based on what you've told me, I think there's definitely something we could do here. I'd like to put together a short proposal with some options. Can I send that over by [day]?"

If there's NOT a fit:
> "Honestly, based on what you've described, I don't think AI automation is the right solution here. What I'd suggest instead is [alternative]. But if things change, feel free to reach out."

---

### Step 11: The Proposal

Keep it simple. One page is fine.

**FORMAT:**

---

**COPY AND EDIT:**

Subject: Proposal for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the conversation! Based on what you shared, here's what I recommend:

**The Problem:**
[1-2 sentences summarizing their pain point in their words]

**The Solution:**
[1-2 sentences describing what you'll do]

**What's Included:**
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

**Investment:**
$[amount]

**Timeline:**
[X] weeks

**Next Steps:**
If this looks good, I can send over a simple agreement and we can get started [date]. Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
Upton

---

**PRICING GUIDANCE:**

| Project Type | Price Range |
|-------------|-------------|
| AI Readiness Assessment (audit + recommendations) | $500 - $1,500 |
| Small Automation Project (one workflow) | $1,500 - $3,000 |
| Medium Project (multiple workflows) | $3,000 - $8,000 |
| Larger Engagement | $8,000 - $25,000 |
| Monthly Retainer | $1,000 - $3,000/month |

**WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CHARGE:**
Start low enough that they'll say yes, high enough that it's worth your time. Your first client is about proof of concept, not maximum revenue.

---

### Step 12: When They Say Yes

**WHAT TO SEND:**

A simple agreement. Not a 20-page contract. Something like:

---

**COPY AND EDIT:**

**CONSULTING AGREEMENT**

This agreement is between BespokeEthos ("Consultant") and [Client Company] ("Client").

**Scope of Work:**
[Copy from your proposal]

**Investment:**
$[amount], due [payment terms — e.g., "50% upfront, 50% on completion" or "due upon completion"]

**Timeline:**
Work will begin on [date] and complete by approximately [date].

**What happens if it doesn't work out:**
Either party can end this agreement with 7 days written notice. Client pays for work completed to date.

**Agreed:**

___________________________ Date: ________
[Your name], BespokeEthos

___________________________ Date: ________
[Client name], [Company]

---

Send as a PDF. They sign, you sign, you're in business.

---

### Step 13: When They Say No (Or Go Silent)

**IF THEY SAY NO:**

> Thanks for letting me know. If anything changes, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with [thing they mentioned].

Move on. No is not personal. No is data.

**IF THEY GO SILENT:**

Follow up once:
> Hi [Name], just following up on the proposal I sent. Any questions I can answer?

If still silent after 5-7 days, send a "break-up" email:
> Hi [Name], I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right. Totally understand. I'll close out my notes on this, but feel free to reach out if things change down the road.

This often gets a response because people feel guilty about ghosting.

Then let it go. Chase the next one.

---

## TRACK 3: SUPPLIER DIVERSITY (CORPORATE)

This is the longer game. Bigger contracts, more process.

---

### Step 14: The Supplier Diversity Landscape

**WHAT IT IS:**
Big companies have programs to buy from diverse-owned businesses (including LGBTQ-owned). Your NGLCC certification gets you in the door.

**THE PLAYERS IN CLEVELAND:**

| Company | Why They Matter |
|---------|-----------------|
| Cleveland Clinic | $175M+ diverse supplier spend |
| University Hospitals | Active diversity program |
| Eaton Corporation | 40% increase in LGBTQ spend |
| Progressive Insurance | NGLCC corporate partner |
| KeyBank | $1B+ diverse spend since 2001 |

**THE REALITY:**
These are 6-12 month cycles. You register, you introduce yourself, you wait for opportunities, you respond to RFPs, you compete. It's worth doing, but it won't pay your bills next month.

**BACKGROUND CHECK REALITY:**
Larger corporate contracts (over $25K) are more likely to trigger background checks. Strategy: start with small pilot projects, build a track record, become "the person who already delivered" before checks happen.

---

### Step 15: Register in Databases

See the SupplierGATEWAY document for step-by-step.

**WHERE TO REGISTER:**
- SupplierGATEWAY (Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals)
- Eaton supplier portal
- Progressive supplier portal
- NGLCC Supplier Database (you may already be here)

---

### Step 16: The Supplier Diversity Outreach Email

After you register, email them directly.

**WHO TO EMAIL:**
- Cleveland Clinic: supplierdiversity@ccf.org
- University Hospitals: supplierinclusion@uhhospitals.org
- Eaton: supplierdiversity@eaton.com

**WHAT TO WRITE:**

---

**COPY THIS:**

### Step 17: Join Plexus

**WHAT IT IS:**
Plexus is Cleveland's LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce—the local NGLCC affiliate.

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
- They make introductions to corporate supplier diversity contacts
- They host events where you meet these people face-to-face
- They know who's actively looking for LGBTQ suppliers
- Community of people who understand your world

**THE ACTION:**
Go to: https://www.thinkplexus.org
Click "Join" or "Membership"
Sign up

**IF IT COSTS MONEY AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT:**
Email them:
> I'm launching an NGLCC-certified AI consulting practice and would love to join Plexus. Cash flow is tight while I build the business — are there reduced rates or payment plans for new members?

Ask. The worst they say is no.

---

## WHEN THINGS GET HARD

---

### When You Don't Know What to Charge

**RULE OF THUMB:**
What's one hour of your time worth? Minimum $100. Ideally $150-250.

Estimate hours × hourly rate = project price.

Then round up, because projects always take longer than you think.

**WHEN IN DOUBT:**
Quote what feels slightly uncomfortable—not painful, but stretchy. If they say yes immediately, you probably priced too low.

---

### When Someone Asks For a Discount

**WHAT TO SAY:**

> I understand budget is a consideration. Let me see if we can adjust the scope to fit your budget. What if we focused just on [smaller piece] for now, and expanded later if it works well?

Don't cut your rate. Cut the scope.

**EXCEPTION:**
LGBTQ+ small businesses get 25% off. That's your policy. You can offer it proactively.

---

### When You're Scared to Reach Out

**THE TRUTH:**
Everyone feels this way. The people who get clients are the ones who reach out anyway.

**THE REFRAME:**
You're not asking for a favor. You're offering to solve a problem. If they don't have that problem, they'll say no. If they do, you're helping them.

**THE ACTION:**
Set a timer for 15 minutes. Send one message. When the timer goes off, you can stop.

One message is infinitely more than zero.

---

### When No One Is Responding

**FIRST:** This is normal. Response rates are 10-20%. You need to send more messages.

**SECOND:** Check your messages. Are they:
- Too long? (Keep under 100 words)
- Too salesy? (Sound like a human, not a brochure)
- Too vague? (Be specific about what you do)

**THIRD:** Try a different channel. If LinkedIn isn't working, try email. If email isn't working, try asking for referrals.

**FOURTH:** Give it time. Sales is a lag indicator. Work you do this week pays off in 2-4 weeks.

---

### When You Get Rejected

**WHAT TO REMEMBER:**
They're not rejecting you. They're saying no to a service they don't need right now.

**WHAT TO DO:**
- Say "thanks for letting me know"
- Update your notes
- Move to the next person

**THE MATH:**
You need 1 yes. If it takes 20 no's to get there, then every no is 5% of the way to yes.

---

### When You Feel Like a Fraud

**THE TRUTH:**
You have:
- 10+ years training AI systems that millions of people use
- Real technical knowledge most consultants don't have
- NGLCC certification that opens doors
- Manufacturing experience that gives you credibility

**THE LIE YOUR BRAIN TELLS:**
"You're not qualified. Who are you to charge money for this?"

**THE RESPONSE:**
Feelings aren't facts. Do the next action anyway.

---

## THE FIRST CLIENT CHECKLIST

**BEFORE YOU FIND THEM:**
- [ ] LinkedIn profile updated
- [ ] Network list created (10-20 names)
- [ ] SupplierGATEWAY registration done
- [ ] Plexus joined (or application submitted)
- [ ] One LinkedIn post published

**FINDING THEM:**
- [ ] 5+ referral asks sent to network
- [ ] 5+ LinkedIn outreach messages sent
- [ ] 1+ supplier diversity intro emails sent

**CONVERTING THEM:**
- [ ] Discovery call completed
- [ ] Proposal sent
- [ ] Agreement signed
- [ ] Deposit received (if applicable)

**AFTER THEY SAY YES:**
- [ ] Work delivered
- [ ] Invoice sent
- [ ] Payment received
- [ ] Testimonial requested

---

## THE NUMBERS TO TRACK

Keep it simple. Track:

| Week | Outreach Sent | Responses | Calls Booked | Proposals Sent | Clients Won | Revenue |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | |

This shows you what's working and what isn't.

---

## REMEMBER

You're not trying to build a sales empire. You're trying to find ONE person who will pay you to solve their problem.

One person.

That's the whole goal right now.

Everything else is just steps toward that one person.

You can do this.
