# SupplierGATEWAY Registration
## Click-by-Click, Field-by-Field, No Assumptions

---

## What This Is

SupplierGATEWAY is a website where big companies (Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, etc.) search for suppliers to hire. You register once, then connect to multiple buyers.

**Why you're doing this:**
When a procurement person at Cleveland Clinic needs an AI consultant, they search this database. If you're not in it, you don't exist to them.

**The background check reality:**
Registration itself does NOT trigger a background check. You're just making yourself findable. Checks happen later, if at all, usually for contracts over $25K. Small engagements ($5K-$15K) often don't trigger them.

---

## Before You Start

**You need:**
- [ ] 60-90 minutes of uninterrupted time
- [ ] Your NGLCC certification number and expiration date
- [ ] A computer (not phone—too many fields)
- [ ] This document open next to your browser

**You might need but can skip for now:**
- DUNS number (can add later)
- CAGE code (only for government work)

**If you don't have a DUNS number:**
That's fine. Leave it blank. You can get one free later at dnb.com if needed.

---

## Step 1: Go to the Website

**THE ACTION:**
Open your browser. Go to: https://www.suppliergateway.com

**WHAT YOU'LL SEE:**
A homepage with search bars and corporate logos.

**WHAT TO CLICK:**
Look for "Register" or "Sign Up" or "Create Account" — usually top right corner.

**GRAY AREA:**
If you can't find the register button, try: https://www.suppliergateway.com/register
If that doesn't work, scroll to the bottom of the page and look for "Supplier Registration."

---

## Step 2: Create Your Account

**WHAT YOU'LL SEE:**
A form asking for basic info.

**WHAT TO ENTER:**

| Field | What to Type |
|-------|--------------|
| Email | contact@bespokeethos.com (or your business email) |
| Password | [Create a strong one, write it down somewhere safe] |
| First Name | Upton |
| Last Name | Rand |
| Phone | 216-773-0090 |

**WHAT TO CLICK:**
"Create Account" or "Register" or "Submit"

**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**
They'll send a verification email. Check your inbox (and spam folder). Click the link to verify.

**GRAY AREA:**
If the verification email doesn't come in 10 minutes, check spam. If still nothing, try registering with a different email (your personal gmail works fine).

---

## Step 3: Company Information

After verifying, you'll log in and see a profile to complete.

**WHAT TO ENTER:**

| Field | What to Type |
|-------|--------------|
| Legal Business Name | Gay Men's Field Guide LLC |
| DBA / Trade Name | BespokeEthos |
| Business Address | 3188 West 111th St |
| City | Cleveland |
| State | OH |
| ZIP | 44111 |
| Country | United States |
| Phone | 216-773-0090 |
| Website | bespokeethos.com |
| Year Established | 2024 |
| Number of Employees | 1 |
| Annual Revenue | Select "Under $500,000" or whatever range includes $0-500K |

**WHY "Gay Men's Field Guide LLC":**
That's your legal entity name—the one on your NGLCC certification. Use BespokeEthos as the DBA (Doing Business As) so that's what shows publicly.

**GRAY AREA:**
If a field is required and you don't know the answer, put "N/A" or "To be provided." Incomplete profiles still show up in searches.

---

## Step 4: Company Description (Short Version)

Some portals ask for a short description (100-150 words). Copy and paste this:

---

**COPY THIS:**

> BespokeEthos is an NGLCC-certified LGBT Business Enterprise (LGBTBE®) providing AI consulting and automation services to healthcare, manufacturing, and enterprise clients in Northeast Ohio. We help organizations implement practical AI solutions that reduce operational costs, streamline workflows, and improve efficiency—without the complexity or inflated pricing of large consulting firms.

---

**WHAT THIS DOES:**
Tells procurement people who you are, what you do, and why they should care (diverse supplier + results).

---

## Step 5: Company Description (Long Version)

Some portals ask for a longer capabilities statement (250-400 words). Copy and paste this:

---

**COPY THIS:**

> **Core Competencies:**
> - AI Strategy Development & Roadmapping

> - AI Implementation & Integration

> contact@bespokeethos.com | 216-773-0090
> bespokeethos.com

---

---

## Step 6: Select Your NAICS Codes

**WHAT NAICS CODES ARE:**
Industry classification codes. Procurement people use these to search for suppliers. You want to be in the right categories.

**WHAT TO SELECT:**

| Code | Description | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **541611** | Administrative Management and General Management Consulting | PRIMARY - this is your main category |
| 541512 | Computer Systems Design Services | AI/tech work |
| 541519 | Other Computer Related Services | Catch-all for AI |
| 541690 | Other Scientific and Technical Consulting | Broader consulting |
| 611430 | Professional and Management Development Training | If you do training |

**HOW TO SELECT:**
The portal will either let you type in codes or search by keyword. Try:
- Typing "541611" directly
- Searching "management consulting"
- Searching "computer consulting"
- Searching "technology consulting"

**GRAY AREA:**
If you can only select 1-3 codes, choose: 541611, 541512, 541519 (in that order of priority).

---

## Step 7: Enter Your Certifications

**WHAT TO SELECT:**
Look for checkboxes or a certification section. Check:
- [x] NGLCC Certified LGBT Business Enterprise (LGBTBE)
- [x] LGBT-Owned Business
- [x] Minority Business Enterprise (if that option exists—LGBTQ sometimes qualifies)

**WHAT TO ENTER:**
| Field | What to Type |
|-------|--------------|
| Certification Type | NGLCC LGBTBE |
| Certification Number | [Your actual NGLCC cert number] |
| Expiration Date | [Your actual expiration date] |
| Certifying Agency | National LGBT Chamber of Commerce |

**IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR CERT NUMBER:**
Log into your NGLCC account at nglcc.org or check the certificate they emailed you when you got certified.

---

## Step 8: Select Service Categories

**WHAT TO CHECK:**
Look for category checkboxes. Select everything relevant:

**Technology & IT:**
- [x] IT Consulting
- [x] Software Services
- [x] Technology Consulting
- [x] Systems Integration
- [x] Data Analytics

**Professional Services:**
- [x] Management Consulting
- [x] Business Process Improvement
- [x] Training & Development
- [x] Strategic Planning

**GRAY AREA:**
When in doubt, check more boxes rather than fewer. You can always narrow later.

---

## Step 9: Add Keywords

Some portals have a "keywords" or "tags" field. Add these:

**COPY THIS LIST:**
> AI consulting, artificial intelligence, automation, machine learning, process optimization, workflow automation, digital transformation, AI implementation, AI strategy, AI training, Cleveland, Northeast Ohio, LGBTBE, LGBT-owned, diverse supplier, small business, healthcare IT, manufacturing automation

**WHY:**
When a procurement person searches "AI consulting Cleveland," these keywords help you show up.

---

## Step 10: Connect to Buyers

After your basic profile is done, you need to connect to specific buyers (companies).

**FOR CLEVELAND CLINIC:**
1. Look for "Connect to Buyer" or "Find Buyers" or "Corporate Connections"
2. Search for "Cleveland Clinic"
3. Click to connect/register with them
4. They may ask additional questions—answer them

**FOR UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS:**
1. Same process
2. Search for "University Hospitals"
3. Connect/register

**DIRECT LINKS (if searching doesn't work):**
- Cleveland Clinic: https://www.suppliergateway.com/ClevelandClinic
- University Hospitals: https://www.suppliergateway.com/UniversityHospitals

---

## Step 11: Save and Submit

**WHAT TO CLICK:**
"Save Profile" or "Submit" or "Complete Registration"

**WHAT HAPPENS:**
Your profile goes into the database. Procurement people can now find you when they search.

**REALITY CHECK:**
Being in the database doesn't mean they'll call tomorrow. It means you're findable when they have a need. This is planting seeds.

---

## Step 12: The Follow-Up Email (Do This Within 24 Hours)

Don't wait for them to find you. Reach out directly.

**WHO TO EMAIL:**

Cleveland Clinic Supplier Diversity: supplierdiversity@ccf.org
University Hospitals: supplierinclusion@uhhospitals.org

**WHAT TO WRITE:**

---

**COPY THIS:**

Subject: LGBTBE AI Consultant — Just Registered in SupplierGATEWAY

Hi,

I'm Upton Rand, founder of BespokeEthos—an NGLCC-certified LGBT Business Enterprise providing AI consulting services. I just completed my registration in SupplierGATEWAY and wanted to introduce myself directly.

I specialize in helping organizations implement practical AI solutions for workflow automation and process optimization. My background combines hands-on manufacturing experience with AI expertise, so I understand operational challenges from the ground level.

I'd welcome the opportunity to learn about any upcoming technology consulting needs where my certification and expertise might be a fit.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute introduction call?

Best regards,
Upton Rand
BespokeEthos | NGLCC Certified LGBTBE

**WHEN TO SEND:**
Within 24 hours of completing registration. Weekday morning (Tuesday-Thursday 9-11 AM is ideal).

---

## What Happens Next

**LIKELY OUTCOMES:**

1. **No response** — Most common. Follow up in 7 days with a shorter email: "Just following up on my note below. Happy to provide any additional information."

2. **Auto-response directing you to register** — You already did. Reply: "Thanks! I've completed registration in SupplierGATEWAY. Please let me know if you need any additional information."

3. **Someone responds with interest** — They may ask questions, schedule a call, or add you to a vendor list. Follow their lead.

4. **Someone responds saying no current needs** — Reply: "Thank you for letting me know. May I check back in 6 months?"

**TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS:**
- Getting a response: 1-4 weeks (or never)
- Getting added to a vendor list: 1-3 months
- Getting an actual opportunity: 3-12 months

This is a long game. You're planting seeds, not harvesting.

---

## If Things Get Complicated

**IF THEY ASK FOR INFORMATION YOU DON'T HAVE:**
Say: "I don't have that currently but can provide it if needed. What's the deadline?"

**IF THEY ASK FOR REFERENCES:**
Say: "I'm building my consulting practice and happy to provide references from my professional network. Would a LinkedIn recommendation suffice, or do you need formal client references?"

**IF THEY ASK ABOUT INSURANCE:**
General liability insurance is often required for larger contracts. You can get it later if needed (~$500-1,000/year for basic coverage). For now, say: "I can obtain the required coverage upon contract award."

**IF THEY WANT TO DO A BACKGROUND CHECK:**
See the main guide. For small engagements, this usually doesn't come up. If it does, use the script from the main document.

**IF YOU GET OVERWHELMED AND CAN'T FINISH:**
Save what you have. Close the browser. Come back tomorrow. An incomplete profile is better than no profile.
