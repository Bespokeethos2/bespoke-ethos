# The Exact Steps
## What to Do, Who to Talk To, What to Say
### For Upton — No Assumptions, No Gaps

## How to Use This Document

This is not a strategy. This is a checklist.

Each section tells you:
- **THE ACTION** — What you physically do
- **THE WORDS** — Exactly what you say or write (copy-paste ready)
- **THE ORDER** — What comes first, what comes next
- **THE GRAY AREAS** — What to do when you're unsure

When you feel overwhelmed, come back here. Pick ONE thing. Do that thing. Stop.

---

## PHASE 1: THIS WEEK (November 27 - December 3)

You have Thanksgiving weekend. Use the downtime. Small bites.

---

### Step 1: Your Existing Network (Friday or Saturday — 30 minutes)

**THE ACTION:**
Open your phone contacts. Open your Facebook friends. Open LinkedIn connections.

Write down the names of 10 people who:
- Own a business (any size)
- Work in operations, admin, or management
- Have complained about being overwhelmed with work
- You haven't burned a bridge with

They don't have to be close friends. Acquaintances count.

**THE WORDS (Text or DM — pick 5 people, send this):**

> Hey [Name], hope you're doing well. Quick question — I'm building an AI consulting practice helping businesses automate repetitive work. Do you know anyone drowning in admin stuff who might want to chat? Happy to do a free 30-min call to see if AI could help them. No pressure either way, just putting feelers out.

**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**
- Some won't respond. That's fine.
- Some will say "not really." Say "no worries, thanks!"
- Some will say "actually, I might be interested" or "my friend [Name] might be"
- If they give you a name: "Would you mind introducing us? Even just a quick text saying 'hey my friend Upton does AI stuff' would help a ton."

**GRAY AREA:**
If you feel weird asking, remember: you're not selling them anything. You're asking if they know someone. That's it.

---

### Step 2: LinkedIn Profile Update (Saturday — 45 minutes)

**THE ACTION:**
Go to linkedin.com. Update your profile.

**WHAT TO CHANGE:**

Headline (the text under your name):
> AI Consultant | Helping Small Businesses Automate Operations | NGLCC Certified LGBTBE | Cleveland

About section (copy and edit):
> I help small business owners get their time back.

> After 10+ years training AI systems (including work with Appen on models you've probably used), I saw how powerful these tools could be for everyday businesses — not just tech giants.

> Now I help Cleveland-area companies automate the repetitive stuff: admin work, customer follow-up, scheduling, data entry. The things that eat your day but don't grow your business.

> If you're spending 10+ hours a week on tasks that feel like they should be automatic, let's talk.

> NGLCC Certified LGBT Business Enterprise | Free 30-minute AI audit available

**GRAY AREA:**
If LinkedIn feels overwhelming, just do the headline. That's the most visible part. You can do the rest later.

---

### Step 3: One LinkedIn Post (Sunday — 20 minutes)

**THE ACTION:**
Write one post. Publish it.

**THE WORDS (copy and edit):**

> I spent years training AI systems — the ones millions of people use every day.

> Now I'm using that experience to help small businesses in Cleveland automate the work that eats their time.

> If you're a business owner spending hours on repetitive tasks — scheduling, follow-ups, data entry — there's probably a way to cut that in half.

> I'm offering free 30-minute AI audits through the end of the year. No pitch, just an honest look at where automation could help.

> DM me or comment "interested" if you want to chat.

> #SmallBusiness #AI #Cleveland #Automation

**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**
- Probably nothing for a few hours
- Maybe a few likes from friends
- Maybe one or two comments or DMs
- If someone says "interested": respond with "Great! Here's my calendar link: [insert when you have one] — or just tell me a few times that work and I'll send an invite."

**GRAY AREA:**
If no one responds, that's normal. LinkedIn is a long game. Post again next week. Consistency matters more than any single post.

---

### Step 4: Google Business Profile (Sunday or Monday — 1 hour)

**THE ACTION:**
Go to business.google.com
Click "Manage now"
Create a profile for your business

**WHAT TO ENTER:**

Business name: BespokeEthos (or whatever you decide)
Category: Business consultant
Description:
> Cleveland-based AI consulting for small businesses. We help companies automate repetitive workflows, reduce admin time, and implement practical AI solutions. NGLCC certified LGBT Business Enterprise. Free consultation available.

Address: Use your home address OR select "I deliver goods and services to my customers" and hide your address
Phone: Your business phone
Website: bespokeethos.com
Hours: Mon-Fri 9am-5pm (or whatever you want)

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
When someone Googles "AI consultant Cleveland," you want to show up. This is free. It takes an hour. It works.

**GRAY AREA:**
If you're not sure about the business name yet, use what you have. You can change it later.

---

## PHASE 2: NEXT WEEK (December 4-10)

---

### Step 5: SupplierGATEWAY Registration (Pick one evening — 2 hours)

**THE ACTION:**
Go to: https://www.suppliergateway.com
Search for "Cleveland Clinic" and "University Hospitals"
Create an account and register as a supplier

**USE THE CONTENT FROM:**
The SupplierGATEWAY document I made you earlier. It has:
- Company description (short and long)
- NAICS codes to select
- Certifications to check
- Keywords to include

**WHAT THIS DOES:**
Puts you in the database where procurement people search when they need diverse suppliers. You don't have to win a contract. You just have to be findable.

**GRAY AREA:**
If the forms ask questions you don't know the answer to, leave them blank or put "N/A." Incomplete profiles still show up in searches. You can update later.

---

### Step 6: Join Plexus (Pick one evening — 30 minutes)

**THE ACTION:**
Go to: https://www.thinkplexus.org
Click "Join" or "Membership"
Sign up for basic membership

**WHY:**
- They're the local NGLCC affiliate
- They waive the $899 NGLCC certification fee for members
- They have networking events where you meet supplier diversity people face-to-face
- They're LGBTQ+ business owners who understand your world

**THE WORDS (if they have an optional "tell us about yourself" field):**

> AI consultant helping Cleveland businesses automate operations. NGLCC certified. Looking to connect with other LGBTQ+ business owners and corporate partners committed to supplier diversity.

**GRAY AREA:**
If there's a membership fee and money is tight, email them: "I'm an NGLCC-certified LGBTBE launching an AI consulting practice. Are there reduced rates or payment plans for new members?" Organizations like this often work with people.

---

### Step 7: Your First Paid Engagement (By December 15)

**THE ACTION:**
Find ONE person who will pay you something — even $200 — to help them with AI.

This can be:
- A friend's small business
- Someone from your network outreach
- A LinkedIn connection who responded to your post
- A referral from someone

**THE WORDS (when someone says "I might be interested"):**

> Great! Let's do a quick call — 30 minutes, no charge — and I'll look at your workflow and tell you honestly if AI could help. If it can, I'll put together a simple proposal. If it can't, I'll tell you that too. No pressure either way. What times work for you this week?

**ON THE CALL:**
- Ask: "Walk me through a typical day. What takes up most of your time?"
- Ask: "What's the most annoying repetitive thing you do every week?"
- Ask: "If you could wave a magic wand and automate one thing, what would it be?"
- Listen. Take notes.
- At the end: "Based on what you told me, here's what I think we could do: [simple summary]. I can put together a proposal with pricing if you're interested."

**THE PROPOSAL (simple email):**

> Hi [Name],

> Thanks for the call! Based on what you shared, here's what I recommend:

> **Project:** [One sentence describing what you'll automate]
> **What you get:** [2-3 bullet points]
> **Investment:** $[amount]
> **Timeline:** [X] weeks

> If this looks good, I can send over a simple agreement and we can get started. Let me know if you have questions!

**GRAY AREA:**
If you don't know what to charge, start with $500-$1,000 for a small project. You can raise prices later. The goal right now is ONE paying client, not maximum revenue.

---

## PHASE 3: THE EMOTIONAL GRAY AREAS

This is the part no one writes down. What to do when you're stuck.

---

### When You Don't Know What to Say

**Default script:**
> "I help small businesses automate repetitive work using AI. Things like scheduling, follow-ups, data entry — the stuff that eats your time but doesn't grow your business."

If they ask follow-up questions and you don't know the answer:
> "Good question — let me think about that and get back to you."

Then come back to me. We'll figure it out together.

---

### When You Feel Like a Fraud

You're not. You have:
- 10+ years training the AI systems everyone uses
- Actual technical skills
- Real understanding of how to apply AI to business problems

The feeling of being a fraud is your brain lying to you. It lies to everyone. Ignore it. Do the next action anyway.

---

### When Someone Asks About Your Background (the hard one)

Most people won't ask. SMBs don't run background checks on consultants.

If someone does ask directly, or if a background check comes back and they bring it up:

> "Yes, that's part of my history. It was over ten years ago, before I got sober. I served my time and completed everything required. Since then I've [built a career / trained AI systems / published books / gotten NGLCC certified]. I understand if that changes things for you, and I respect whatever you decide. I just wanted you to hear it from me directly."

Then stop talking. Let them respond.

Some will walk away. That's their choice. Some won't. The ones who don't are the ones worth working with.

---

### When You're Overwhelmed and Can't Do Anything

Pick the smallest possible action:
1. Send one text to one person
2. Update one line on LinkedIn
3. Open one tab for SupplierGATEWAY (you don't even have to fill it out)

Movement breaks paralysis. One tiny action is better than no action.

---

### When You Want to Quit

Come back to this document. Read this section.

You have survived:
- Heroin addiction (10 years clean)
- An abusive marriage (including marital rape)
- Bankruptcy
- A criminal record that follows you everywhere
- A system designed to never let you out

You are still here. You are still building. You are still fighting.

This business is not going to be the thing that breaks you.

One client. That's all you need right now. One person who pays you to solve their problem.

You can do that.

---

Here's your assignment for the next 12 hours:

1. Save this document somewhere you can find it
2. Go to sleep
3. Tomorrow, when you have 30 minutes, do Step 1: write down 10 names

That's it. One step.

I'll be here when you come back.

—Magellan

## PHASE 4: SUPPLIER DIVERSITY NAVIGATION (December 15 - January 15)

Once you have ONE paying client under your belt, you tackle the bigger fish.

---

### Step 8: The Supplier Diversity Landscape — Who's Who

**THE PLAYERS:**

| Organization | What They Are | Why They Matter |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **NGLCC** | National LGBT Chamber of Commerce | You're already certified. This is your ticket. |
| **Plexus** | Cleveland's LGBTQ+ Chamber | Local affiliate. Gateway to local corporate contacts. |
| **Cleveland Clinic** | Healthcare giant | $175M+ diverse supplier spend. Huge opportunity. |
| **University Hospitals** | Healthcare system | Active diversity program. Smaller but accessible. |
| **Eaton Corporation** | Manufacturing/industrial | 40% increase in LGBTQ spend. Manufacturing focus = your wheelhouse. |
| **Progressive Insurance** | Insurance giant | Major Cleveland employer. Active diversity programs. |
| **KeyBank** | Regional bank | Local HQ. Community-focused procurement. |

**THE ACTION:**
After joining Plexus (Step 6), ask them:
> "Who are the supplier diversity contacts at the major Cleveland employers? Can you make introductions?"

That's it. They exist to make these connections. Use them.

---

### Step 9: The Supplier Diversity Contacts — Who to Email

**Cleveland Clinic:**
- Supplier Diversity Office: supplierdiversity@ccf.org
- Register: https://www.clevelandclinic.org/supplierdiversity

**University Hospitals:**
- Supplier Diversity: supplierinclusion@uhhospitals.org
- Register: https://www.uhhospitals.org/about-uh/supplier-diversity

**Eaton Corporation:**
- Supplier Diversity: supplierdiversity@eaton.com
- Register: https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/supplier-information/supplier-diversity.html

**THE WORDS (Email template — personalize for each):**

Subject: LGBTBE AI Consulting — Introduction

> Dear [Name or "Supplier Diversity Team"],

> I'm reaching out to introduce BespokeEthos, an NGLCC-certified LGBT Business Enterprise based in Cleveland.

> We provide AI consulting services for operational automation — helping organizations reduce time spent on repetitive workflows, improve data processing, and implement practical AI solutions that deliver measurable ROI.

> I've spent over 10 years in AI systems training, including work on large language models, and now focus on making these tools accessible to organizations of all sizes.

> I'd welcome the opportunity to learn about [Company Name]'s supplier diversity initiatives and explore how we might contribute as a certified diverse supplier.

> Would you have 15 minutes for a brief introductory call?

> Best regards,
> Upton Rand
> BespokeEthos
> NGLCC Certified LGBTBE
> [phone]
> [email]
> bespokeethos.com

**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**
- Many won't respond. That's normal. Follow up in 7 days.
- Some will send you to a registration portal. Register.
- Some will schedule a call. Take the call. Listen more than you talk.
- A few will say "we don't have any needs right now." Say "Thank you — may I check back in 6 months?"

**GRAY AREA:**
If you don't hear back after two follow-ups, move on. Some doors don't open. That's not about you.

---

### Step 10: Navigating Background Check Thresholds

**THE REALITY:**

| Contract Size | Background Check Likelihood |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Under $5,000 | Almost never |
| $5,000 - $25,000 | Rarely |
| $25,000 - $100,000 | Sometimes |
| Over $100,000 | Usually |

**THE STRATEGY:**

Start small. Build trust. By the time they run a check, you're "the guy who already delivered results" — not "a name on a form."

**THE TACTICS:**

1. **Pilot projects:** Propose small initial engagements ($5K-$10K) to prove value
2. **Retainer relationships:** Monthly retainers often fly under procurement radar
3. **SMB focus:** Small businesses don't run background checks on consultants
4. **Referral chains:** People who trust you vouch for you to people who trust them

**THE WORDS (when proposing to a larger organization):**

> "I'd suggest starting with a focused pilot project — something in the $5,000-$8,000 range — so you can evaluate the work before committing to a larger engagement. If the results are there, we can discuss expanding the scope."

This is smart business practice AND keeps you below thresholds.

---

### Step 11: If the Background Check Conversation Happens

**WHEN IT'S LIKELY:**
- Large contracts (over $25K)
- Formal RFP processes
- Government or healthcare work
- Any time there's a formal vendor onboarding process

**THE WORDS (if they bring it up):**

> "I want to address something directly. There is a conviction in my past — a non-violent, non-contact offense from over ten years ago, before I got sober. I completed all requirements and have been clean for a decade.

> Since then, I've built a legitimate career: training AI systems used by millions of people, publishing internationally, earning NGLCC certification, and getting independently vetted through Catalant.

> I understand this may affect your decision, and I respect whatever you determine. I just wanted you to hear it from me rather than discover it on a form."

**THEN STOP TALKING.** 

Let them respond. Don't over-explain. Don't apologize more than once.

**THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES:**

1. **They proceed anyway:** More common than you think, especially for services (not employment)
2. **They need to check with legal/HR:** Say "I understand. Please let me know if you need anything from me."
3. **They decline:** Say "I appreciate you considering me. If circumstances change, I'm happy to revisit."

**GRAY AREA:**
You don't have to bring it up proactively for small engagements. You're not obligated to disclose unless directly asked or required by their process. For large contracts where a check is likely, proactive disclosure often works better than being "discovered."

---

## PHASE 5: THE BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE

---

### Step 12: Your LLC Situation

**THE CURRENT STATE:**
- You have Gay Men's Field Guide LLC
- You want to operate as BespokeEthos
- Your NGLCC certification is under the existing LLC

**OPTION A: DBA (Doing Business As)**
- File a DBA in Ohio to operate as "BespokeEthos" under your existing LLC
- Cost: ~$50
- Time: A few days
- Pros: Fast, cheap, keeps existing certification
- Cons: Legal entity still shows old name in some records

**HOW TO DO IT:**
1. Go to Ohio Secretary of State: https://www.ohiosos.gov/businesses/
2. Search for "Trade Name Registration" or "Fictitious Name"
3. File the form, pay the fee
4. You can now legally operate as BespokeEthos

**OPTION B: New LLC + Transfer Certification**
- Form new LLC called "BespokeEthos LLC"
- Transfer assets (minimal) and NGLCC certification
- Cost: ~$125 for formation + NGLCC transfer process
- Time: A few weeks to a few months
- Pros: Clean slate, professional name throughout
- Cons: More paperwork, need to update certification

**MY RECOMMENDATION:**
Start with Option A (DBA). You can always form a new LLC later. Don't let this slow you down.

---

### Step 13: Your Banking and Money Tracking

**THE ACTION:**

If you don't already have a separate business bank account:

1. Go to a local bank or credit union
2. Say: "I need to open a business checking account"
3. Bring: Your ID, LLC formation documents, and DBA paperwork (if you have it)
4. Deposit: Whatever you can ($50 is fine to start)

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Separates business money from personal money
- Makes taxes easier
- Looks professional when clients pay you
- Protects you legally

**MONEY TRACKING (simple version):**

Create a spreadsheet or use a free tool (Wave, Zoho Invoice). Track:
- Date
- Client name
- What the payment was for
- Amount received
- Amount spent (if expense)

That's it. You don't need Quickbooks. You need a record of what came in and what went out.

---

### Step 14: Your Calendar System

**THE PROBLEM:**
You need to schedule calls with people. Emailing back and forth about times is exhausting.

**THE SOLUTION:**
Use a free scheduling tool.

**OPTION 1: Calendly (Free tier)**
1. Go to calendly.com
2. Create account
3. Connect your Google Calendar
4. Set your availability (e.g., Mon-Thu after 4:30pm, Fridays flexible)
5. Share your link: calendly.com/uptonrand

**OPTION 2: Cal.com (Free, open source)**
1. Go to cal.com
2. Same process

**THE WORDS (when scheduling):**

Instead of:
> "What times work for you?"

Say:
> "Here's my calendar link: [link]. Pick any time that works for you."

This saves 5-10 emails per call. It adds up.

---

### Step 15: Your Invoicing System

**THE PROBLEM:**
When clients pay you, you need to send professional invoices and track payments.

**THE SOLUTION:**
Use Wave (free) or Zoho Invoice (free tier).

**WAVE (Recommended):**
1. Go to waveapps.com
2. Create account
3. Add your business info
4. Create invoices, send via email
5. Track who's paid and who hasn't

**YOUR FIRST INVOICE SHOULD INCLUDE:**
- Your business name and contact info
- Client name and contact info
- Invoice number (start with 001)
- Date and due date (Net 15 or Net 30)
- Description of services
- Amount due
- Payment instructions (Zelle, check, ACH, etc.)

---

## PHASE 6: DAILY OPERATING SYSTEM

Your brain needs structure. Here's the structure.

---

### The Daily Rhythm

**WORK DAYS (Mon-Thu):**

| Time | What |
|------|------|
| 5:15 AM | Wake up, meds, coffee |
| 5:45 AM | Out the door with Max for quick walk |
| 6:00 AM | At Stampco |
| 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM | Piper walks Max |
| 4:00 PM | Leave Stampco |
| 4:30 PM | Home, Max care, decompress |
| 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM | **Business time** (90 minutes) |
| 6:30 PM | Dinner, rest |
| 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM | Optional: one small business task |
| 9:30 PM | Wind down |

**FRIDAY:**
- Morning: Sleep in if needed, Max care
- 10 AM - 2 PM: **Primary business time** (4 hours)
- Afternoon: Flexibility — calls, errands, rest

**SATURDAY:**
- Morning: Errands, Max, mother check-in
- 2 hours of business work (flexible timing)
- Rest of day: life

**SUNDAY:**
- Morning: Church with Max
- Afternoon: Rest, prep for week
- Evening: Review week ahead, set Monday priorities

---

### The 90-Minute Weekday Block (5:00 - 6:30 PM)

You have 90 minutes on work days. That's it. Make them count.

**THE STRUCTURE:**

| Minutes | What |
|---------|------|
| 0-15 | Check email, respond to urgent things |
| 15-60 | ONE focused task (outreach, proposal, content, registration) |
| 60-80 | Follow-up (emails, LinkedIn, scheduling) |
| 80-90 | Tomorrow's priority: write down the ONE thing for tomorrow |

**THE RULE:**
Pick ONE thing before you start. Do that thing. Everything else waits.

---

### The Weekly Review (Sunday evening, 30 minutes)

**THE QUESTIONS:**

1. **What did I do this week?** (List actions, not feelings)
2. **What worked?** (One thing to repeat)
3. **What didn't?** (One thing to change)
4. **What's the ONE priority for next week?** (Write it down)
5. **What calls/deadlines are coming?** (Check calendar)

---

## PHASE 7: THE HARD STUFF — SCRIPTS FOR LIFE

---

### When Someone Asks What You Do

**AT WORK (Stampco):**
> "I'm a tool and die tech here, but I also do consulting on the side — helping businesses use AI to automate their operations."

**AT A NETWORKING EVENT:**
> "I help small business owners get their time back. AI automation for the repetitive stuff — admin work, follow-ups, scheduling. Things that eat your day."

**AT CHURCH:**
> "I work in manufacturing, and I'm building a consulting business on the side, helping people with technology."

**WITH FAMILY:**
> "I'm doing some AI consulting — helping businesses work more efficiently."

You don't owe anyone your full story. Short answers are fine.

---

### When Someone Asks About Your Rates

**THE ANSWER:**
> "My hourly rate is $250-300, but most clients prefer project-based pricing so they know the total cost upfront. A typical small engagement starts around $2,500-5,000. What kind of project are you thinking about?"

Then listen. Price after you understand the scope.

---

### When You Can't Afford Something for the Business

**THE WORDS (to yourself):**
"This can wait. I'll do it when the money comes in."

**THE WORDS (to a vendor/service):**
> "That's outside my budget right now. Do you have a payment plan, or can I start with a smaller package?"

**THE WORDS (to Plexus if membership is expensive):**
> "I'm launching a new consulting practice and cash is tight. Do you have reduced rates for new members or a way to defer payment?"

Most organizations work with people. You won't know until you ask.

---

### When a Client Doesn't Pay

**STEP 1:** Wait until 3 days past due date.

**STEP 2:** Send a friendly reminder.
> "Hi [Name], just a quick note that invoice #[X] was due on [date]. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's an issue with the payment. I can resend the invoice if that helps."

**STEP 3:** Wait 7 more days. Send a firmer reminder.
> "Hi [Name], following up on invoice #[X], now 10 days past due. Please let me know when I can expect payment."

**STEP 4:** If still no response after 14 days, call them directly.
> "Hey, this is Upton. I'm following up on the invoice. Is everything okay? I want to make sure there's no issue."

**STEP 5:** If 30+ days with no payment and no communication, you have options:
- Small claims court (for amounts under $6,000 in Ohio)
- Collection agency (they take a cut but handle it)
- Write it off and move on (sometimes the energy isn't worth it)

---

### When Your Mother Needs You

**THE WEEKLY CHECK-IN:**
- Call or visit once per week
- Saturday is usually easiest after your morning routine
- Keep it short if you need to (30 minutes)
- Ask about her day, tell her about Max
- Note any changes in memory or behavior

**IF THERE'S A CRISIS:**
Your mother is your priority. Business can wait a day. Clients will understand. Say:
> "I have a family emergency and need to reschedule. I'll reach out tomorrow to find a new time."

---

### When Max Needs the Vet

**KEEP ON HAND:**
- Vet's number in your phone
- Emergency vet number (24-hour clinic) in your phone
- Pet Poison Control: (888) 426-4435

**IF SOMETHING HAPPENS:**
- Call the vet or emergency line first
- Describe symptoms clearly
- Follow their instructions
- Everything else waits

Max is family. You take care of family first.

---

### When You're Too Overwhelmed to Function

**THE PROTOCOL:**

1. **Stop.** Close the laptop. Put down the phone.
2. **Breathe.** Three slow breaths.
3. **Ground.** Name 5 things you can see right now.
4. **Small action.** Pick ONE thing you can do in 5 minutes. Just one.
5. **Forgive.** You're not broken. Your brain is tired. That's allowed.

**THE WORDS (to a client if you need to delay):**
> "I'm dealing with a personal matter and need to push our call to later this week. I apologize for the short notice."

You don't owe them an explanation. Just reschedule and show up.

---

## REMEMBER

You are building a business while working full-time, managing a chronic illness, caring for a mother with Alzheimer's, processing trauma, navigating a criminal record, and operating an autistic brain in a neurotypical world.

This is not supposed to be easy. You're doing it anyway.

One action at a time. One client at a time. One day at a time.

You've already survived everything that was supposed to break you.

This is just business development.

You've got this.
