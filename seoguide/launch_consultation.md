# Strategic recommendations for Upton Rand's AI consulting launch

**Bottom line:** Change the name "BespokeEthos" before filing your DBA today. Your current pricing is **3-30x below market** and signals inexperience. Below are specific, decisive recommendations requiring no further deliberation—designed to eliminate your outreach paralysis and get you moving.

## Verdict on "BespokeEthos": NO—change it today

Research on B2B naming psychology is unambiguous: descriptive names outperform abstract names for service businesses targeting time-strapped buyers. "BespokeEthos" fails on every metric that matters for your market.

**Why it doesn't work:**

The name combines two abstract words that require explanation—a luxury exhausted founders don't have. Neither "Bespoke" nor "Ethos" signals AI, automation, consulting, or technology. Enterprise procurement officers categorizing suppliers by capability cannot immediately slot you into "AI consulting." SEO-wise, you'll compete from a deficit for "AI consulting Cleveland" searches without heavy content marketing investment you can't afford at launch.

Successful SMB-focused AI consultancies almost universally include a functional anchor word. Your Cleveland competitors—Centric Consulting, AtNetPlus, AI Business Consulting—all follow this pattern. The Association for Consumer Research found that "brands with descriptive names were consistently rated as higher quality, more effective, and more likely to purchase."

**Your replacement name (choose one today):**

| Recommended Name | Why It Works |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Rand AI Consulting** | Personal accountability + clear service + professional for Cleveland Clinic RFPs |
| **ClearPath AI** | Suggests clarity + guidance, signals AI, easy to remember, 3 syllables |
| **Streamline AI Consulting** | Outcome-focused (efficiency), descriptive, works for SMBs and enterprise |

Pick **Rand AI Consulting** if you want personal brand equity and trust-building with SMBs. Pick **ClearPath AI** if you want a name that scales beyond you. Either is vastly superior to BespokeEthos.

## Service description: clarity over creativity

Your current product names are creative but some require clearer descriptive terms for SEO and buyer comprehension. For autistic clarity and tired-founder comprehension, define products by what they actually deliver:

| Product Name | Problem | **Descriptive Service Name / Searchable Term** |
|--------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| Cadence | Abstract, no service signal for a chatbot | **AI Customer Service Chatbot / AI Concierge** |
| Consensus Engine | "Engine" is vague, metaphor unclear | **AI Research Assistant** |
| Automation Rescue | Abstract / unclear metaphor | **Automation Repair & Optimization** |
| Flowstack | Tech jargon, generic | **Workflow Automation Setup** |

**Rationale for each:**

**Cadence** is the name of the AI Customer Service Chatbot. It provides direct, on-brand customer interaction. Its descriptive service name as "AI Customer Service Chatbot" or "AI Concierge" clearly communicates its function to SMB founders seeking customer support automation.

**Consensus Engine** uses industry-standard language for what you're building. "Research agents in digital debate" is a feature description, not a value proposition. Founders immediately understand what they're buying.

**Automation Rescue** directly addresses the pain point. It's urgent, actionable, and requires zero explanation. When someone's automation breaks at 2 AM, they'll search for "automation repair" not "red-bridging."

**Workflow Automation Setup** describes the deliverable in plain language. "Flowstack" means nothing to non-technical buyers.

## Pricing: raise immediately or signal amateur status

Your current pricing of **$49-149/month** is dangerously low. Market benchmarks show:

| Service Type | Your Price | Market Price |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Ongoing automation support | $49-149/mo | **$500-5,000/mo** |
| Initial automation builds | Low upfront | **$2,500-15,000** |
| AI consulting retainers | Subscription only | **$2,000-5,000/mo** |

**Why underpricing hurts you:**

Research from Consulting Success shows clients "don't take you seriously—and thus don't listen to you—unless you charge enough for them to notice." Behavioral economics studies demonstrate identical products are rated higher when priced higher. Multiple consultants report being *more likely to lose a sale by underpricing* than overpricing—low prices signal misunderstanding of the work's complexity.

**Your new pricing structure:**

| Service | Setup Fee | Monthly Support |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| AI Strategy Sprint | $2,500-5,000 | N/A (project-based) |
| Workflow Automation Setup | $3,000-8,000 | $500/mo optional |
| AI Research Assistant | $1,500-3,000 | $350/mo |
| Automation Rescue | $500-1,500 (one-time) | $500/mo retainer |

**Position the subscription differently:** Instead of "$49/month insurance," offer **"AI Protection Plan: $500/month"** that includes monitoring, 2 hours of support, and priority response. The AppleCare model works, but AppleCare prices reflect real value—yours should too.

For founders without capital, offer payment plans on setup fees (3-month split) rather than artificially low monthly rates that destroy your margins and credibility.

## Subscription management: two tools, one decision

**If you want simplicity: Bonsai Starter ($24/month)**

Purpose-built for freelancers and solo consultants. Combines proposals, contracts (legally vetted templates), recurring invoicing, and basic client portal. Setup takes minutes. Handles unlimited clients. Integrates with Stripe for automatic payment collection at standard 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Mobile app for iOS and Android.

**If you want automation: HoneyBook Essentials ($49/month)**

Superior workflow automation—triggers that automatically move clients through your pipeline, send follow-ups, and collect payments. Built-in scheduler for booking consultations. Native QuickBooks sync for accounting. White-label branding removes HoneyBook logo. Supports 2 team members if you expand.

**My recommendation: Start with Bonsai.** You don't need HoneyBook's automation complexity while building from 1-20 clients. When you hit 25+ clients and feel the administrative burden, migrate to HoneyBook. Both offer 7-day free trials.

## Discount structure: expand to coalition model

**Recommendation: Keep your 25% LGBTQ+ discount AND add 20% for other certified diverse-owned businesses.**

| Category | Discount | Verification |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| LGBTQ+-owned small businesses | **25%** | NGLCC certification or self-attestation |
| Minority-owned (MBE) | **20%** | NMSDC certification |
| Women-owned (WBE) | **20%** | WBENC certification |
| Veteran-owned (VBE/SDVOSB) | **20%** | NaVOBA certification |
| Disability-owned (DOBE) | **20%** | Disability:IN certification |

**Why this works for Cleveland Clinic:**

Cleveland Clinic's supplier diversity program explicitly supports "minorities, women, veterans, and members of the LGBTQ community"—they treat all categories as equal partners in their coalition approach. Their DEI Supplier Accelerator and Mentor Protégé programs demonstrate commitment to broad-based diverse business development.

By offering community pricing to the entire coalition while maintaining your highest discount for LGBTQ+ businesses, you:
- **Demonstrate shared values** aligned with enterprise supplier diversity goals
- **Support Cleveland Clinic's Tier 2 tracking**—if your diverse clients serve their suppliers, your impact multiplies
- **Show authentic LGBTQ+ identity** (higher discount for your community) while signaling coalition commitment
- **Expand your referral network** across all diverse business certification ecosystems

**Your positioning statement for Cleveland Clinic RFPs:**

*"As an NGLCC-certified LGBTQ+-owned business, we support the entire coalition of diverse entrepreneurs through community pricing for all certified diverse-owned small businesses. This reflects our belief that economic empowerment strengthens all marginalized communities—a commitment that aligns with Cleveland Clinic's anchor institution mission."*

## Action checklist for today

Your 10+ years training frontier AI models at Appen is exceptional credibility. Your NGLCC certification opens enterprise doors. Stop underpricing yourself and hiding behind abstract naming.
