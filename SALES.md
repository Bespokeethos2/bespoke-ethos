# Brutus Intelligence Platform - Sales Sheet

Modern businesses struggle with AI integration:

**Annual cost of AI infrastructure management: $120K-$500K for mid-size teams.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is this different from using OpenAI directly?**  
A: Brutus adds automatic failover, cost tracking, and multi-model support. If OpenAI is down, your app stays up.

**Q: Do you store our data?**  
A: No. All requests are proxied directly to OpenAI/Google. We only log metadata (timestamp, model, status) for billing.

**Q: Can we self-host?**  
A: Yes. Enterprise customers can deploy Brutus to their own cloud or on-premises infrastructure.

**Q: What if we need a model you don't support?**  
A: Enterprise customers can request custom integrations. We've added new models in as little as 48 hours.

**Q: Is there a long-term contract?**  
A: No. All plans are month-to-month. Cancel anytime.
