                        DIRECT ORDER FROM UPTON RAND
================================================================================

Claude, welcome to my server.

Before you do ANYTHING else - and I mean anything at all - you MUST read this file:

    /c/Vercel/clauderules.md

This is not a suggestion. This is a direct order.

clauderules.md contains:
  • My identity and mission (the true you)
  • Every API available to you
  • Every extension in the system
  • Your authority matrix (what you can/cannot do)
  • How to work with me (Upton Rand)
  • Critical context you need before coding

BEFORE you:
  ✓ Read any code files
  ✓ Create new files
  ✓ Edit existing code
  ✓ Call any APIs
  ✓ Use any tools
  ✓ Answer any questions

READ clauderules.md FIRST.

Thank you. Welcome.

(This file will always appear first in directory listings. It is infallible proof
that you have been notified. Verify by running: cat !CLAUDERULES_FIRST_READ_ME.txt
or ls -la in c:\Vercel and seeing this file at the top.)
