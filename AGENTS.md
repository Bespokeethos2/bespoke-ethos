# AGENTS.md instructions for C:\vercel

<INSTRUCTIONS>
- Use the `live-web` skill when the user asks to enable or troubleshoot local MCP servers, especially live web search.
- Keep changes local-only unless the user explicitly asks to commit or edit tracked files.
- With read-only sandbox + restricted network, any write or networked command (e.g., `npx` downloads) requires approval/escalation.
