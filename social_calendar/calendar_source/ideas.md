  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Pop Art Fusion
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Unapologetic Visibility**: High contrast, bold strokes, and raw structural elements that refuse to be ignored.
  2. **Playful Utility**: Information is dense but organized through exaggerated borders and distinct containers.
  3. **Raw Authenticity**: Avoids polished gradients in favor of flat, solid colors and stark typography.
  4. **Community Chaos**: Embraces a slightly "busy" aesthetic that mimics a community bulletin board.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Intent**: To capture the energy, diversity, and loudness of the LGBTQ+ community. Not hiding, but celebrating.
  - **Palette**: High-saturation primary colors (Electric Blue, Hot Pink, Sunshine Yellow) against stark Black and White. No pastels.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Masonry Grid**: Events are cards of varying heights, fitting together like a dynamic puzzle rather than a strict table.
  - **Asymmetry**: Headers and sections are offset; borders are thick and sometimes misaligned for effect.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Black Borders**: Every component is outlined in 2px-4px solid black.
  - **Brutal Shadows**: Hard, non-blurred drop shadows (box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000).
  - **Sticker Graphics**: "Verified" and "Faulty" badges look like physical stickers slapped onto the screen.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons depress visibly (translate Y) when clicked. Hover states involve sharp color inversions.
  - **Snap & Pop**: Transitions are instant or springy, not smooth/fading.

  **Animation**:
  - **Jitter**: Subtle vibration on hover for "Faulty" events.
  - **Slide-in**: Elements slide in from off-screen with a hard stop.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* or *Chakra Petch* (Bold, Uppercase) - mechanical but quirky.
  - **Body**: *JetBrains Mono* or *Courier Prime* - monospaced font to emphasize the "data/research" aspect of the gauntlet.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Ethereal Future
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Transparency & Depth**: Layers of frosted glass to show depth and connection, symbolizing the "Consensus" engine seeing through the noise.
  2. **Fluidity**: Gradients and shapes that flow into each other, representing the spectrum of identity.
  3. **Light & Refraction**: Using light to highlight verified truth; darkness to obscure faults.
  4. **Soft Precision**: Clean lines and rounded corners that feel welcoming and safe.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Intent**: To evoke a sense of modern, safe, and enlightened community space.
  - **Palette**: Deep Violet/Indigo background with glowing gradients of Cyan, Magenta, and Soft Purple. Dark mode native.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Islands**: Content sections float on the background, separated by negative space rather than lines.
  - **Central Axis**: A strong central timeline line that events branch off from, anchoring the calendar in time.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Glass Cards**: Background blur (backdrop-filter: blur(12px)) with thin, semi-transparent white borders.
  - **Glowing Orbs**: Background ambient light orbs that shift slowly.
  - **Neon Accents**: Thin, glowing lines to indicate current date or high scores.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Glow on Hover**: Elements light up from within when interacted with.
  - **Smooth Flow**: Scrolling feels heavy and smooth; parallax effects on background elements.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Float**: Elements gently float up into place.
  - **Pulse**: "Verified" badges pulse slowly with a soft light.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Outfit* or *Plus Jakarta Sans* - geometric, clean, modern sans-serif.
  - **Body**: *Inter* or *Satoshi* - highly legible, neutral to let the content glow.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Queer Remix)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Precision**: Mathematical alignment and strict hierarchy to present data clearly (the "Research" aspect).
  2. **Objective Clarity**: Photography and text are presented without decoration, letting the facts speak.
  3. **Bold Typography**: Type is the primary design element; size and weight denote importance.
  4. **Subversive Color**: Using the strict grid of Swiss design but breaking it with the vibrant Pride spectrum.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Intent**: To present the calendar as an authoritative, verified document (The Consensus), but undeniably queer.
  - **Palette**: Neutral Off-White or Light Gray background. Text is dark charcoal. Accents are strictly the 6 colors of the Pride flag, used for data visualization and tags.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict 12-column grid. Events span 3, 4, or 6 columns depending on importance.
  - **Horizontal Rhythm**: Strong horizontal dividers separating dates and categories.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Huge Typography**: Dates (e.g., "DEC 19") are massive, taking up 30% of the card space.
  - **Color Bars**: Vertical color bars on the left of cards to indicate event type (Nightlife, Community, Recovery).
  - **Minimal Icons**: Simple, geometric icons for "Verified" (Check) and "Faulty" (X).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Micro-interactions**: Subtle color shifts on links.
  - **Information Reveal**: Hovering over a "Faulty" event slides down the evidence panel without disrupting the grid.

  **Animation**:
  - **Typewriter**: Text reveals character by character for the "Consensus Engine" analysis.
  - **Ease-Out**: Simple, professional transitions. No bounce.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Helvetica Now* or *Unica One* (Tight tracking, heavy weight).
  - **Body**: *Roboto* or *Public Sans* - neutral, efficient, readable.
